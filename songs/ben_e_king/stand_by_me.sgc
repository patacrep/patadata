When the [C]night has come [Am] and the land is dark
And the [F]moon is the [G]only light we [C]see
{newline}
No I won't be afraid, oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

{start_of_chorus}
  So darling, darling, stand by me, oh stand by me
  Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
{end_of_chorus}

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
{newline}
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

{start_of_chorus}
  Whenever your in trouble won't you stand by me, oh stand by me
  Oh stand, oh stand, stand by me
{end_of_chorus}
