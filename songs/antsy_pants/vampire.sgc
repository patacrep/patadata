    I am a [Dm]vampire, I am a vampire
    I am a vampire, I am a vampire
    I am a vampire vampire, I am a vampire
    I have lost [G]my [C]fangs
    I am a [Dm]vampire, I am a vampire
    I am a vampire, I have lost [G]my [C]fangs
  

  \begin{verse*}
    So I'm [Dm]sad and [G]I feel [C]lonely
    So I [Dm]cry and [G]{I'm} very [C]angry
    And I [Dm]ate [G]some gar[C]lic
    So I'm [Dm]no more [G]sata[C]nic yeah yeah
  \end{verse*}

    I [D]am a vampi[C]re and I am wal[A]king in the ci[D]ty
    But the [C]pretty [A]girls [D]don't look at me
    \echo{Don't look at me}
    Cause I [G]{don't} [A]have [D]my fangs
    Cause I [G]have [A]lost [D]my fangs

    I am a vampire, I am a vampire
    I have lost my mouth organ
    I am a vampire, I am a vampire
    I have lost my mouth organ
  

  \begin{verse*}
    So I get bored and I shout
    So I eat popcorn and I put on weight
    And I sing but my voice is breaking
    And I want to play the guitar
    But my guitar is out of tune
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    I am a vampire and I'm walking in the city
    But the musicals don't play with me
    \echo{Don't play with me}
    Cause I don't have my mouth organ
    And I have lost my mouth organ
  {end_of_chorus}
