    [F] In constant [C]sorrow, all through his [F]days
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    [F]I am the man of constant [B&]sorrow
    I've seen [C]trouble all my [F]days
    [F]I bid farewell to old Ken[B&]tucky
    The place where [C]I was born and [F]raised
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    The place where he was born and raised

    For six long years, I've been in trouble
    No pleasure here, on earth, I've found
    For in this world, I'm bound to ramble
    I have no friends to help me now
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    He has no friends to help him now
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    It's fair thee well, my old true lover
    I never expect to see you again
    For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad
    Perhaps I'll die upon this train
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Perhaps he'll die upon this train
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    You can bury me in some deep valley
    For many years where I may lay
    And you may learn to love another
    While I am sleeping in my grave
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    While he is sleeping in his grave
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
    My face you never will see no more
    But there is one promise that is given
    I'll meet you on God's golden shore
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    He'll meet you on God's golden shore
  {end_of_chorus}
