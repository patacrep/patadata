{guitar_comment: Intro: [G C G D] {repeat: 2}}
{newline}
The [G]mama pajama rolled out of bed
And ran to the police [C]station
When the [D]papa found out, he began to shout
And he started the investi[G]gation
{newline}
It's against the [D]law
It was against the [G]law
What the mama [D]saw
It was against the [G]law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, ``Oh, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention''

{start_of_chorus}
  Well, I'm on my [C]way
  I don't know [G]where I'm going
  I'm on my [C]way
  I'm takin' my [G]time but I don't know [D]where
  Goodbye [C]Rosie the [F]Queen of Co[G]rona
  See you, me and [F]Julio [C]down by the [D]school[G]yard [C]
  See you, [G]me and [F]Julio [C]down by the [D]school[G]yard [C]
{end_of_chorus}

In a couple of days they come and take me away
But the press let the story leak
Now when the radical priest come to get me released
He's all on the cover of Newsweek
