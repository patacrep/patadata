  [D] And here's to [G]you Mrs. [Em]Robinson
  [G]Jesus loves you [Em]more than you will [C]know, {echo: wo wo [Am]wo}
  [D]God bless you [G]please Mrs. [Em]Robinson
  [G]Heaven holds a [Em]place for those who [C]pray, {echo: hey hey [Am]hey}
{end_of_chorus}

[E7]We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
[A]We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
[D]Look around you, [G]all you see are [C]sympathetic [Am]eyes
[E7]Stroll around the grounds un[D]til you feel at home

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it, when you've got to choose
Any way you look at it you lose

{start_of_chorus}
  Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?
  A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, {echo: wo wo wo}
  What's that you say Mrs. Robinson?
  Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, {echo: hey hey hey, hey hey hey}
{end_of_chorus}
