[G]I hear the [C]drizzle [G]of the rain
[Am]Like a me[Am6]mory it [D7]falls
[G]Soft and [Bm]warm con[G]tinu[C]ing
[Am]Tapping on my [D]roof and [C]walls[G C G]

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets
To England were my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you're start your day

And a song I was writing, is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I
