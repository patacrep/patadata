  \begin{chorus}
    \[Am]Are you going to \[Em]Scarborough \[Am]Fair
    \[C] Parsley, \[Am]sage, rose\[C]ma\[D]ry and \[Am]thyme
    Remember \[C]me to one who lives \[G]there
    \[Am]She once \[G]was a \[Am]true love \[Em]of \[Am]mine
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
    \echo{On the side of a hill in the deep forest green}
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    \echo{Tracing of sparrow on snow crested brown}
    Without no seams nor needle work
    \echo{Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain}
    Then she'll be a true love of mine
    \echo{Sleeps unaware of the clarion call}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Tell her to find me an acre of land
    \echo{On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves}
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    \echo{Washes the grave with silvery tears}
    Between the salt water and the sea strands
    \echo{A soldier cleans and polishes a gun}
    Then she'll be a true love of mine
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
    \echo{War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions}
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    \echo{Generals order their soldiers to kill}
    And gather it all in a bunch of heather
    \echo{And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten}
    Then she'll be a true love of mine
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Are you going to Scarborough Fair
    Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
    Remember me to one who lives there
    She was once a true love of mine
  \end{verse}
