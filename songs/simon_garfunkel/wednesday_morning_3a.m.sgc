    I can [C]hear the soft [Am]breathing of the [F]girl that I [Em]love
    As she [C]lies here be[Dm]side me a[G]sleep with the night
    And her [C]hair in a [Am]fine mist [F]floats on my [Em]pillow
    Re[C]flecting the [Dm]glow of the [F]win[G]ter moon[C]light
  

  
    She is soft she is warm but my heart remains heavy
    As I watch as her breasts gently rise, gently fall
    For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving
    And tonight will be all I have left to recall
  

  
    Oh what have I done, why have I done it
    I've committed a crime, broken the law
    For twenty five dollars and pieces of silver
    I held up and robbed a hard liquor store
  

  
    My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion
    A scene badly written in which I must play
    And I know as I gaze at my young love beside me
    The morning is just a few hours away
