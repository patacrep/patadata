    I'd [Em]rather be a sparrow than a [G]snail
    Yes I would, if I could, I surely [Em]would
  

  \begin{verse*}
    I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
    Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    A[C]way, I'd rather sail away
    Like a [G]swan that's here and gone
    A [C]man gets tied up to the ground
    He gives the [G]world its saddest sound
    Its saddest [Em]sound
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    I'd rather be a forest than a street
    Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
  

  \begin{verse*}
    I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
    Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
  \end{verse*}
