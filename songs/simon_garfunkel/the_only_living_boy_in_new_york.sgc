[C]Tom, get your plane right on [F]time
[C]I know your part'll go [F]fine
[C]Fly down to Mexi[F C Dm F]co

{start_of_chorus}
  [G]Do-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da and [F]here I am
  The [C]only living boy in [F]New York
{end_of_chorus}

I get the news I need from the weather report
I can gather all the news I need from the weather report
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile

[Am] [Dm]Half of the time we're gone
[G7]But we don't know [C]where
And we don't know [F]where

Tom, get your plane right on time
I know that you've been eager to fly now
Hey, let your honesty shine, shine, shine now

{start_of_chorus}
  Do-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-do like it shines on me
  The only living boy in New York {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}
