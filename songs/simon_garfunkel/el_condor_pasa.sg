  \begin{verse}
    I'd \[Em]rather be a sparrow than a \[G]snail
    Yes I would, if I could, I surely \[Em]would
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
    Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{chorus}
    A\[C]way, I'd rather sail away
    Like a \[G]swan that's here and gone
    A \[C]man gets tied up to the ground
    He gives the \[G]world its saddest sound
    Its saddest \[Em]sound
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    I'd rather be a forest than a street
    Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
    Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
  \end{verse*}
