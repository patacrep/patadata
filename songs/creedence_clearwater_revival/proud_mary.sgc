  \musicnote {\Intro: \nolyrics [C A C A C A G F G D}


  
   [D]Left a good job in the city
   Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day
   And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
   Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
   [A]Big wheel keep on turnin'
   [Bm]Proud Mary keep on burnin'
   [D]Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
  

   \textnote[french]{reprendre l'intro}

  
  Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
  Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
  But I never saw the good side of the city
  'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
  Big wheel keep on turnin'
  Proud Mary keep on burnin'
  Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river \rep{2}
  

   \textnote[french]{reprendre l'intro}

  
  If you come down to the river
  Bet you gonna find some people who live
  You don't have to worry 'cause you have [if you got] no money
  People on the river are happy to give
  Big wheel keep on turnin'
  Proud Mary keep on burnin'
  Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river\rep{2}
