    The [F]guilty undertaker sighs
    The [Am]lonesome organ grinder cries
    The [Dm]silver saxophones say
    I [C]should refuse you
  

  \begin{verse*}
    The [B&]cracked bells and washed-out horns
    [C]Blow into my face with scorn
    But [Dm]{it's} not that way
    I wasn't born to [C]lose you
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    I [F]want you, I [Am]want you
    I [Dm]want you so [C]bad
    Honey, I [F]want you
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      The [F]drunken politician leaps
      U[Am]pon the street where mothers weep
      And the [Dm]saviors who are fast asleep
      They [C]wait for you
    

    \begin{verse*}
      And [B&]{I wait} for them to interrupt
      Me [C]drinkin' from my broken cup
      And [Dm]ask me to
      Open up the [C]gate for you
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}

  \begin{bridge}
    Now [Am]all my fathers, they've gone down
    [Dm]True love they've been without it
    But [Am]all their daughters put me down
    'Cause [B&]{I don't} think a[C]bout it
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      Well, I re[F]turn to the Queen of Spades
      And [Am]talk with my chambermaid
      [Dm]She knows that I'm not afraid
      To [C]look at her
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [B&]She is good to me
      And [C]there's nothing she doesn't see
      She [Dm]knows where I'd like to be
      But it doesn't [C]matter
    \end{verse*}

    
      Now your [F]dancing child with his Chinese suit
      He [Am]spoke to me, I took his flute
      [Dm]No, I wasn't very cute to him
      [C]Was I?
    

    \begin{verse*}
      But [B&]{I did} it, though, because he lied
      [C]Because he took you for a ride
      [Dm]And because time was on his side
      [C]And because I{\dots}
    \end{verse*}
