[D]How many [G]roads must a [A]man walk [D]down
Be[D]fore you [G]call him a [A]man?
[D]How many [G]seas must a [A]white dove [D]sail
Be[D]fore she [G]sleeps in the [A]sand?
{echo: Yes and} [D]how many [G]times must the [A]cannon balls [D]fly
Be[D]fore they're [G]forever [A]banned?

{start_of_chorus}
  [G]The answer my [A]friend is [D]blowin' in the [G]wind
  The [G]answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind
{end_of_chorus}

{echo: Yes and} how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the seas?
{echo: Yes and} how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
{echo: Yes and} how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

{echo: Yes and} how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
{echo: Yes and} how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
{echo: Yes and} how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
