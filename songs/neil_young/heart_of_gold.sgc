[Em] I want to [C]live, [D] I want to [G]give
[Em] I've been a [C]miner for a [D]heart of gold [G]
[Em] It seems ex[C]pressions, [D] I never [G]give

{start_of_chorus}
  [Em] It keeps me [C]searching for a [D]heart of gold [G]
  [C]And I'm getting older [Em]
  {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I've cross the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

You keep me searching for a heart of gold
You keep me searching and I'm growing old
You keep me searching for a heart of gold
