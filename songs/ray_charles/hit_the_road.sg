  \begin{chorus}
    Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
    No more, no more, no more, no more
    Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
    No more

  \textnote{oh what you say?}

  \begin{verse}
    Old woman, old woman, oh you treat me so mean,
    You're the meanest old woman that I ever have seen.
    I guess if you said so
    I'd have to pack my things and go.
  \end{verse}

  \textnote{That's right}

  \begin{verse}
    Now baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way
    'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day.
    Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
    you got no money you just ain't no good.
    Well, I guess if you say so
    I'd have to pack my things and go.
  \end{verse}
