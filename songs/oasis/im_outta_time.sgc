    [Em]Here's a song
    It reminds me of when [Esus4]we were young
    Looking back at all the [Am]things we'd done
    Gotta keep on [C]keeping on
  

  
    Out to sea
    It's the only place I honestly
    Can get myself some peace of mind
    You know it's getting hard to fly
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [G]If I'm to fall
    [D]Would you be there to applaud?
    Or [Em]would you hide behind them all?
    Cause if I have to [Am]go
    In my heart you [C]grow
    And that's where you be[G]long
    \rep{2}
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    [G]Guess I'm outta time
    I'm outta time
    [Em]I'm outta time
    [Am]I'm outta time
    [C]I'm outta time
