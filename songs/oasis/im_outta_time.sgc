[Em]Here's a song
It reminds me of when [Esus4]we were young
Looking back at all the [Am]things we'd done
Gotta keep on [C]keeping on

Out to sea
It's the only place I honestly
Can get myself some peace of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly

{start_of_chorus}
  [G]If I'm to fall
  [D]Would you be there to applaud?
  Or [Em]would you hide behind them all?
  Cause if I have to [Am]go
  In my heart you [C]grow
  And that's where you be[G]long
  {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}

[G]Guess I'm outta time
I'm outta time
[Em]I'm outta time
[Am]I'm outta time
[C]I'm outta time
