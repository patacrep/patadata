[Em7]Today is [G]gonna be the day that they're [Dsus4]gonna throw it back to [A7sus4]you
[Em7]By now you [G]should've somehow realiz[Dsus4]ed what you gotta [A7sus4]do
[Em7]I don't believe that [G]anybody [Dsus4]feels the way I [A7sus4]do
About you [C]now [Dsus4 A7sus4]

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

{start_of_chorus}
  And [C]all the roads we [Dsus4]have to walk are [Em7]winding
  And [C]all the lights that [Dsus4]lead us there are [Em7]blinding
  [C]There are many [Dsus4]things that I would [G]like to
  [G/F#]Say to [Em7]you but I [Dsus4]don't know [A7sus4]how
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  Because [C]maybe, [Em7] [G]
  [Em7]You're gonna be the one that [C]saves me [Em7] [G]
  And [Em7]after [C]all, [Em7] [G]you're my [Em7]wonder[C]wall [Em7 G Em7]
{end_of_chorus}

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

{start_of_chorus}
  I said maybe, {echo: I said maybe}
  You're gonna be the one that saves me
  And after all, you're my wonderwall
{end_of_chorus}
