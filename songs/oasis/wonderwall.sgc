    [Em7]Today is [G]gonna be the day that they're [Dsus4]{gonna throw} it back to [A7sus4]you
    [Em7]{By now} you [G]should've somehow realiz[Dsus4]{ed what} you gotta [A7sus4]do
    [Em7]{I don't} believe that [G]anybody [Dsus4]{feels the} way I [A7sus4]do
    About you [C]now [Dsus4 A7sus4]
  

  
    Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
    I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
    About you now
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    And [C]all the roads we [Dsus4]{have to} walk are [Em7]winding
    And [C]all the lights that [Dsus4]{lead us} there are [Em7]blinding
    [C]There are many [Dsus4]{things that} I would [G]like to
    [G/F#]{Say to} [Em7]you but I [Dsus4]{don't know} [A7sus4]how
  {end_of_chorus}

  {start_of_chorus}
    Because [C]maybe, [Em7] [G]
    [Em7]You're gonna be the one that [C]saves me [Em7] [G]
    And [Em7]after [C]all, [Em7] [G]you're my [Em7]wonder[C]wall [Em7 G Em7]
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
    By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
    About you now
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    I said maybe, \echo{I said maybe}
    You're gonna be the one that saves me
    And after all, you're my wonderwall
