    [Dm]When she was just a [B&]girl
    [F]She expected the [C]world
    But it [Dm]flew away from her [B&]reach
    So she [F]ran away in her [C]sleep
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Dreamed of [Gm]para, para, [B&] paradise
    [F]Para, para, [C] paradise
    [Gm]Para, para, [B&] paradise
    [F]Every time she [C]closed her eyes
  {end_of_chorus}


  
    When she was just a girl
    She expected the world
    But it flew away from her reach
    And bullets catch in her teeth
  

  \begin{bridge}
    [Dm]Life goes on, it [B&]gets so heavy
    The [F]wheel breaks the [C]butterfly
    [Gm]Every tear, a water[C]fall
    In the [B&]night, the stormy [F]night, she closed her [C]eyes
    In the [B&]night, the stormy [F]night, away she [C]flies
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{bridge}
    Still [B&]lying under[F]neath the stormy [C]skies
    She said, [B&m]oh oh, [F]oh oh oh oh, I know the [C]sun's set to rise
  \end{bridge}
