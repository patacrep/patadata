    [Am]She would [C]never [F]say where [G]she came [C]from
    [Am]Yesterday [D]don't [F]matter [C]if it's [G]gone
    [Am]While the [D7]sun is [G]bright or [Am]in the [D7]darkest [G]night
    No one [C]knows, she comes and [G]goes
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C]Good[G]bye [C]Ruby Tuesday, who could [G]hang a name [C]on you
    [C]When you [G]change with [B&]every [F]new day
    [G]Still I'm gonna [C]miss [G]you
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Don't question why she needs to be so free
    Tell you it's the only way to be
    She just can't be chained to a life where nothings gained
    And nothings lost, at such a cost
  


  
    There's no time to lose I heard her say
    She'll cash your dreams before they slip away
    Dying all the time, lose your dreams and you'll lose your mind
    Ain't life unkind
