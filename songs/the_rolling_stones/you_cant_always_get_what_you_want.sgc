I [G]saw her today at the re[C]ception
A [G]glass of wine in her [C]hand
I [G]knew she was gonna meet her con[C]nection
At her [G]feet was a footloose [C]man

{start_of_chorus}
  You [G]can't always get what you [C]want {repeat: 3}
  But if you [A]try sometimes, [C]you might find
  You get what you [G]need... Ah[C]
  [G]Yeah... [C]...
{end_of_chorus}

I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing ``we're gonna vent our frustration
And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse''

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
{newline}
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
And he said one word to me, and that was ``dead''
I said to him:

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands
