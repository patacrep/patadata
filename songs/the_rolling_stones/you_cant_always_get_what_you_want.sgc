    I [G]saw her today at the re[C]ception
    A [G]glass of wine in her [C]hand
    I [G]knew she was gonna meet her con[C]nection
    At her [G]feet was a footloose [C]man

    I went down to the demonstration
    To get my fair share of abuse
    Singing ``we're gonna vent our frustration
    And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse''
  


  
    I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
    To get your prescription filled
    I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
    And man, did he look pretty ill
  

  \begin{verse*}
    We decided that we would have a soda
    My favorite flavor, cherry red

    And he said one word to me, and that was ``dead''
    I said to him:

    In her glass was a bleeding man
    She was practiced at the art of deception
    Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands
