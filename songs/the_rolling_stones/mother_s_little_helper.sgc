Wh[Am]at a dr[C]ag it i[D]s getting [Em]old
{newline}
[Em]Kids are different today I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her [F]down [D]
And though [G]she's not really ill there's a [C]little yellow [Am]pill
She goes running for the shelt[D]er of her mother's little helper
And it [Em]helps her on her way gets her through her busy day

[Em]Things are different today I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a [F]drag [D]
So she [G]buys an instant cake and she [C]burns a frozen [Am]steak
And goes running for the shelt[D]er of her mother's little helper
And to [Em]helps her on her way get her through her busy day

{start_of_chorus}
  [C]Doctor please some [D]more of these
  Outside the [G]door she took four [C]more
  [Am]What a d[C]rag it i[D]s getting [Em]old
{end_of_chorus}

[Em]Men just aren't the same today I hear every mother say
They just don't appreciate that you get [F]tired [D]
They're so [G]hard to satisfy you can [C]tranquilize your [Am]mind
So go running for the shelt[D]er of your mother's little helper
And for to [Em]help you through the night help to minimise your plight

{start_of_chorus}
  [C]Doctor please some [D]more of these
  Outside the [G]door she took four [C]more
  [Am]What a d[C]rag it i[D]s getting [Em]old
{end_of_chorus}

[Em]Life's just much too hard today I hear every mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a [F]bore [D]
And if [G]you take more of those you will [C]get an over[Am]dose
No more running for the shelter [D]of a mother's little helper
They just [Em]helped you on your way through your busy dying day
