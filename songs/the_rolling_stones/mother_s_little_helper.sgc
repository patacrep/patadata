  \begin{verse*}
  Wh[Am]at a dr[C]ag it i[D]s getting [Em]old
  \end{verse*}

  
  [Em]Kids are different today I hear every mother say
  Mother needs something today to calm her [F]down [D]
  And though [G]she's not really ill there's a [C]little yellow [Am]pill
  She goes running for the shelt[D]er of her mother's little helper
  And it [Em]helps her on her way gets her through her busy day
  

  
  \begin{repeatedchords}
  [Em]Things are different today I hear every mother say
  Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a [F]drag [D]
  So she [G]buys an instant cake and she [C]burns a frozen [Am]steak
  And goes running for the shelt[D]er of her mother's little helper
  And to [Em]helps her on her way get her through her busy day
  \end{repeatedchords}
  

  {start_of_chorus}
  [C]Doctor please some [D]more of these
  Outside the [G]door she took four [C]more
  [Am]What a d[C]rag it i[D]s getting [Em]old
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
  
  [Em]Men just aren't the same today I hear every mother say
  They just don't appreciate that you get [F]tired [D]
  They're so [G]hard to satisfy you can [C]tranquilize your [Am]mind
  So go running for the shelt[D]er of your mother's little helper
  And for to [Em]help you through the night help to minimise your plight
  

  {start_of_chorus}
  [C]Doctor please some [D]more of these
  Outside the [G]door she took four [C]more
  [Am]What a d[C]rag it i[D]s getting [Em]old
  {end_of_chorus}

  
  [Em]Life's just much too hard today I hear every mother say
  The pursuit of happiness just seems a [F]bore [D]
  And if [G]you take more of those you will [C]get an over[Am]dose
  No more running for the shelter [D]of a mother's little helper
  They just [Em]helped you on your way through your busy dying day
  
  \end{repeatedchords}
