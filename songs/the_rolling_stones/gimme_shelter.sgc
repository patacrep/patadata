[B] Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

  It's just a shot [A]away

[B] Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way

  It's just a shot away

My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

  [A] It's just a shot away [A]I tell you
  [B] Love, sis[A]ter, [G]it's just a kiss away
  It's just a kiss [A]away
