[B]Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I [F#]tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I [G#m]fell right through the cracks
And now I'm [E]trying to get back
Before the [B]cool done run out
I'll be giving it my best
[F#]Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I [G#m]reckon it's again my turn to [E]win some or learn some

{start_of_chorus}
  [B]I won't hesita[F#]te no more, no [G#m]more
  It cannot [E]wait, I'm yours [B F# G#m E]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  [B]Well open up your mind and see like [F#]me
  Open up your plans and damn you're [G#m]free
  Look into your heart and you'll find [E]love love love
  [B]Listen to the music of the moment come and dance with [F#]me
  I like one big [G#m]family
  It's your God-forsaken right to be [E]loved love love [B]love
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  [B]So I won't hesita[F#]te no more, no [G#m]more
  It cannot [E]wait I'm sure
  There's no [B]need to complica[F#]te
  Our time is [G#m]short
  This is our [E]fate, I'm yours [B F# G#m E]

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

{start_of_chorus}
  I won't hesitate no more, no more
  It cannot wait I'm sure
  There's no need to complicate
  Our time is short
  This is our fate, I'm yours
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  Well no no, well open up your mind and see like me
  Open up your plans and damn you're free
  Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
  Listen to the music of the moment maybe sing with me
  I like peaceful melodies
  It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  I won't hesitate no more
  Oh no more, no more, no more
  It's your God-forsaken right to be loved, I'm sure
  There's no need to complicate
  Our time is short
  This is our fate, I'm yours
{end_of_chorus}
