    [D]So called Mr. Rock 'n Roll he's dancing on his own again
    Talking on his phone again to someone, who tells him that his
    [G]Balance is low, he's got nowhere to go, he's on his [D]own again

      [D]Rock chic of the century is acting like she used to be
      Dancing like there's no one there before she ever seemed to care now
      [G]She wouldn't dare, it's so rock 'n roll to be a[D]lone

    And they'll [A4]meet one day far away and say
    [Em7]{I wish} I was something more
    And they'll [A4]meet one day far away and say
    [Em7]{I wish} I knew you, I wish I knew you before

      [D]Mrs. Black and White, she's never seen a shade of grey
      Always something on her mind, every single day
      But now she's [G]lost her way, and where does she go from he[D]re?

      [D]Mr. Multicultural sees all that one could see
      He's living proof of someone very different to me
      But now he [G]wants to be free, free so he can se[D]e

    He'll say [Em7]{I wish} I knew you
    [A4]{I wish} I met you when [G]time was still on my [D]side
    She'll say [Em7]{I wish} I knew you
    [A4]{I wish} I loved you [G]before I was his [A4]bride

      And [D]so they must be depart too many moral broken hearts
      But I've seen that all before in TV, books and films and more
      And there's [G]a happy ending, every single day [D]
