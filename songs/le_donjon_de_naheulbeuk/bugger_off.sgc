  {start_of_chorus}
    So bugger [C]off, you bastards, [G]bugger [C]off! \echo{Fuck You!}
    Bugger [Am]off, you bastards, bugger [G]off! \echo{Fuck You!}
    Like a [C]herd of bloody swine who re[F]fuse to leave the [G]trough
    You'll [C]get no more this [F]evening so you [C]bastards [G]bugger [C]off
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    You've [C]been a splendid audience but [G]{oh the} time does [C]pass
    Now [C]don't you all be [F]let the door to hit you in the [G]ass
    [Am]You've been a lovely audience but [G]enough is e[C]nough
    We'd [C]take it very [F]kindly if you'd [C]all just [G]bugger [C]off
  

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [C]Here's to all the waitresses who've been [G]servin' you your [C]beers
      And [C]put up with your [F]noxious breath and your stupid drunken [G]leers
      Be [Am]leavin' all your money on the [F]table when you [G]go
      To[C]morrow you'll have a [F]sorry head and [G]nothin' else to [C]show
    

    
      [C]Here's to all the ladies who might be [G]waitin' for the [C]band
      And [C]thinkin' one of [F]them might make a charming one night [G]stand
      [Am]Please don't be offended girls this [F]song is not for [G]you
      We'll [C]be happy to o[F]blige you when this [G]nasty job is [C]through
    

    
      So [C]now you promise the ladies a [G]night of lovin' [C]bliss
      But [C]truth be told you're [F]far too drunk to stand up straight and [G]piss
      [Am]Givin' up you bloody sods, you'll [F]not be getting [G]laid
      And the [C]sooner you're [F]out the door, the [G]sooner we'll be [C]paid
    
  \end{repeatedchords}
