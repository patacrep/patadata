    To [Bm]each and [A]every [D]one of [C]you
    [Em]I say good[Bm]bye, fare[D]well, of [A]you
    [Bm] To each and [A]all I [D]say good[C]bye
    I [Em]know it's been [Bm]fun but we're [F#7]living a [Bm]lie

      You [Bm]said you [A]spoke straight [D]from your [C]heart
      But [Em]that was the [Bm]one thing that [D]kept us a[A]part
      [Bm] 'Cause when I [A]read bet[D]ween the [C]lines
      I [Em]saw that the [Bm]only heart [F#7]speaking was [Bm]mine

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Bm] To each and every[D7]one of you
    I [G]say goodbye, in[Gsus4]deed I do
    [Bm] If you should ask me [D7]why I go
    I [G]wouldn't say 'cause [Gsus4]you should know

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [Bm] When every[A]thing is [D]said and [C]done
      [Em]Nothing's been [Bm]lost and [D]nothing's been [A]won
      [Bm] I took from [A]you, [D] you took from [C]me
      [Em]But I sup[Bm]pose that's how [F#7]it had to [Bm]be
