    An [E]old [A]man [E]turned ninety-[F#m]eight
    He [E]won the lotte[A]ry and [E]died the next [F#m]day
    It's a [E]black [A]fly in your [E]Chardon[F#m]nay
    It's a [E]death row [A]pardon two [E]minutes too [F#m]late
    And isn't it i[E]ronic? [A] Don't you think? [E F#m]
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    It's like rain[E A] on your [E]wedding [F#m]day
    It's a free [E]ride [A] when you've [E]already [F#m]paid
    It's the good ad[E]vice [A] that you [E]just didn't [F#m]take
    And [G]who would've [F#m]thought it fi[E]gures

      Mr. [E]Play-it-[A]Safe was a[E]fraid to [F#m]fly
      He packed his [E]suit[A]case and kissed his [E]kids good[F#m]bye
      He waited his [E]whole damn [A]life to [E]take that [F#m]flight
      And as the [E]plane crashed [A]down he thought, ``[E]Well isn't this [F#m]nice''
      And isn't it i[E]ronic? [A] Don't you think? [E F#m]

    Well [D]life has a funny [E]way
    Of sneaking up on you when you think everything's [D]okay
    And everything's going [E]right
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{bridge}
    And [D]life has a funny [E]way
    Of helping you out when you think everything's gone [D]wrong
    And everything blows up in your [A]face
  \end{bridge}


  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      A [E]traffic [A]jam when you're [E]already late [F#m]
      A no-[E]smoking [A]sign on your [E]cigarette [F#m]break
      It's like [E]ten thousand [A]spoons when all you [E]need is a [F#m]knife
      It's [E]meeting the man of my [A]dreams and then [E]meeting his beautiful [F#m]wife
      And isn't it i[E]ronic? [A] Don't you think? [E F#m]
      A little too [E]ironic [A] and yeah, [E]I really do [F#m]think
    
  \end{repeatedchords}

  \begin{bridge}
    [D]Life has a funny way of sneaking up on [E]you
    [D]Life has a funny, funny way of helping you [E]out
    Helping you out
