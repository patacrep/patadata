    From [Am]old Eu[G]rope to Aus[F]trali[E7]a
    There's a [Am]growing [G]feeling of hys[F]teri[E7]a
    [Am]Driven by the [G]fear of mis[F]understood [E7]threats
    The [Am]Dark Side [G]wants to filter [F]Inter[E7]net
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    We [C]share the same tech[E7]nology
    E[Am]ducation, for [E7]all, for free
    Be[Am]lieve me [G]when I [F]tweet to [E7]you
    I hope go[Am]vernments love In[E7]ternet [Am]too

    Should I share my little boys
    Pictures of Zuckerberg's friendly toys?
    Will Google still give him the opportunity
    To enjoy like we did neutrality?
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Some hackers say, ``We will protect you''
    I don't subscribe to this point of view
    It's such an ignorant thing to do
    If the cowboys love their children too
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    There is no historical precedent
    To reach the world's citizens on a global Net
    ``Old economists can rule this new world''
    Is a lie, I don't believe anymore
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    @nk\_m say, ``I will fiber you''
    I do subscribe to this point of view
    This is the least that we can do
    If we truly love our children 2.0
