Old [G]pirates, yes, they r[Em]ob I
Sold [C]I to the [G]merchant [Am]ships
[G]Minutes after they took [Em]I
[C]From the bo[G]ttomless [Am]pit
{newline}
But my [G]hand was made [Em]strong
[C]By the hand [G]of the Almigh[Am]ty
We fo[G]rward in this gene[Em]ration
Triumphan[D]tly

{start_of_chorus}
  Won't you help to [G]sing [C]
  These [D]songs of [G]freedom?
  'Cause [C]all I [D]ever have [Em C]
  Re[D]demption [G]songs {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
{newline}
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book
