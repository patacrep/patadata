  [C] No [G]woman, no cry [C G]

[C] Said I [G]remember [Am]when we used to sit [F]
[C] In the govern[G]ment yard in [Am]Trenchtown [F]
[C] Oba, ob-[G]serving the [Am]hypocrites [F]
[C] As they would [G]mingle with the good people [Am]we meet [F]
{newline}
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this bright future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
Log wood burnin' through the night
{newline}
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
{newline}
But while I'm gone

{start_of_bridge}
[C] Everything's gonna [G]be alright
[Am] Everything's gonna [F]be al[G]right
{repeat: 4}
