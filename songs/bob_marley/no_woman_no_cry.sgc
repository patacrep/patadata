    [C] Said I [G]remember [Am]when we used to sit [F]
    [C] In the govern[G]ment yard in [Am]Trenchtown [F]
    [C] Oba, ob-[G]serving the [Am]hypocrites [F]
    [C] As they would [G]mingle with the good people [Am]we meet [F]
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost
    Along the way
    In this bright future, you can't forget your past
    So dry your tears I say
  \end{verse*}

  
    Said I remember when we used to sit
    In the government yard in Trenchtown
    And then Georgie would make the fire light
    Log wood burnin' through the night
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Then we would cook corn meal porridge
    Of which I'll share with you
    My feet is my only carriage
    So I've got to push on through
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    But while I'm gone
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{bridge}
    [C] Everything's gonna [G]be alright
    [Am] Everything's gonna [F]be al[G]right
