I have [G]been a wild rover for many's a [C]year
And I [D]spent all my money on whiskey and [G]beer
But [G]now I'm returning with gold in great [C]store
And I [G]never will play the wild [D]rover no [G]more

{start_of_chorus}
  And it's [D]no, nay, never
  [G] No, nay, never no [C]more
  Will I [G]play the wild [C]rover
  No, [D]never, no [G]more
{end_of_chorus}

I went [G]into an Ale House I used to fre[C]quent
And I [D]told the landlady my money was [G]spent
I [G]asked her for credit she answered me, ``[C]Nay!''
``Such [G]custom as [D]yours, I could have any [G]day''

I [G]took from my pocket, ten sovereigns [C]bright
And the [D]landlady's eyes opened wide with de[G]light
She [G]said I'd have whiskey and wines of the [C]best
And the [G]words that she [D]told me were only in [G]jest

I'll [G]go home to my parents, confess what I've [C]done
And I'll [D]ask them to pardon their prodigal [G]son
And [G]when they've caressed me as oft' times be[C]fore
Then I [G]never will [D]play the wild rover no [G]more
