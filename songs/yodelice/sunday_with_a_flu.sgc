{newline}
[Bm]Closed my door, forgot my key
Missed my bus in the pouring rain
It's [G]been the usual Su[D]nday with a flu [Bm]
[G]And I just can't [D]get over you [Bm]

Burnt my toast and lost your number
Cut my finger, spilled my beer
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

{start_of_chorus}
  I [G]put your stockings
  [D]In my purple boots [Bm]
  [G]What if I do[D]n't get over you? [Bm]
{end_of_chorus}

Had a chat and left my hat
Ate my dog and walked my cat
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

{guitar_comment: Chorus; whistled verse; Chorus}

Called a cabbage, threw the garbage
Asked for help and got some kelp
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

{guitar_comment: Chorus}
