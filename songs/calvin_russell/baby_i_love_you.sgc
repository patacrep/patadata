{newline}
[D]And now the thoughts of you so [Am]fine
Is rollin' through my [G]mind
It's ruling all of my [D]time
[D]I can almost touch your [Am]skin
It takes my senses [G]in
And my dreams [D]begin

{start_of_chorus}
  Baby I love [C]you
  I can't [G]help it
  No matter [D]what I try
  But I [C]never want to cage [G]you
  I want to see you [D]fly
{end_of_chorus}

[D]And the picture of your perfect [Am]face
Is so quick to re[G]place
Any other thoughts that I [D]make
I've searched the world for a girl like [Am]you
To tell my story [G]to
And you're my dream come [D]true
