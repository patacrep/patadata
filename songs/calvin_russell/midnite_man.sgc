    [Am] I hear the whistle of the [E]Midnite Man
    [E]Rollin' down the Texas [Am]plain [Dm]
    Such a [E]beautiful song
    But it [Dm]sounds so wrong
    [E]Till I get you back ag[Am]ain oh oh oh
  

  
    [Am] There's something missing in this [E]poor heart of mine
    L[E]ike an empty boxcar o[Am]ut on the railroad line [Dm]
    Oh how I miss [E]you
    I miss [Dm]you
    Oh how [E]I miss you
    [Dm] With every breath [E]
    That I take [Am]

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [Am] The whippoorwill and the [E] mockingbird
      [E] They make a sound like you [Am] ain't never heard [Dm]
      Still I miss [E]you
      Oh how I miss [Dm]you
      I miss [E]you
      Oh [Dm]how I miss you
      Yes [E]I miss you
      [Dm] With every [E]breath
      That I take [Am]
    
  \end{repeatedchords}
