{newline}
Well I k[C]now it's been a [G]hard road [Em] for so long n[Am]ow
And i[F]t's taken you for [G]a ride [Em] down down d[Am]own
But you must la[G][G7]ugh even th[C]ough [Em] it [Am]seems [D7] that you should c[G]ry [G7] [C] [D7]

Each m[C]orning [G]brings us [Em] a different d[Am]ay
And i[F]t's counting o[G]ur lives [Em] down down d[Am]own
But you must t[G]ry [G7] unt[C]il [Em] at l[Am]ast [D7]you'll know wh[G]y [G4]

[C]A grain of sand, [Em]one single leaf
[Am]A candle by itself burn[D7]ing
[C]I'm just a man, [Em]only a man
[Am]And the rules of life [D7]I'm still learning
[C]Turn me round, turn me roun[G]d
[G]Well people for [C]years I g[D]athered the [G]tears
I l[C]ooked for the frowns [G]on your faces
Now I w[C]alk down the street
And [D]the people that I me[G]et
[C]One by one I've met tho[G]usands
And that's wh[C]y that I fe[G]el
That to g[Am]ive is the fruit
The fruit of liv[D7]ing our l[G]ifes[G7] [C] [Em] [Am] [D7] [G]
