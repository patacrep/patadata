    [Em] Walking a[Asus2]lone
    [Em]' care for no [Asus2]one
    [Em] I'm so cru[Asus2]el
    [Em]' look like a [Asus2]{dog without} its bone
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [Am] I go my [Dm]way
    [Am] Without a [Dm]gaze
    [Am] If you ask [Dm]help
    [Am] I will an[Dm]swer, ``No way!''
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    I used to be
    Truly happy
    Acting gently
    Sharing my joy with everybody
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    My faith in life
    As a sunlight
    Showed me the line
    Between bad and right
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Em]Since I was a [C]child
    I've [Em]tried to do things [C]right
    But [F]being a good [Em]soul
    On[F]ly gets me trou[Em]bles
    Now [G]it's o[Em]ver
    Kind[G]ness has disap[Em]peared
    And [C]from that [Em]day
    I'll [C]take the devil's [Em]way
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    I had a good friend
    Who was in pain
    With love affairs
    I help him chase his pain away
  

  \begin{verse*}
    He found a woman
    She left her man
    They plan a marriage
    She used to be my wife
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Now I'm single
    And hate females
    But sex is vital
    All means are good, most are cruel
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Getting her drunk
    Using some drugs
    For a good fuck
    Remaining pride is scum
  \end{verse*}

  \musicnote{\Chorus}

  
    I had a job
    ' wasn't too rough
    ' screwed lids on pots
    So people can open it up
  

  \begin{verse*}
    They replaced me
    By a machine
    Without a penny
    My pockets were empty
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Now I'm a robber
    I've start little
    With some elders
    And I've leveled to big hold-ups
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Now I'm an outlaw
    Chased by forces
    But I am loaded
    And finally happy!
  \end{verse*}
