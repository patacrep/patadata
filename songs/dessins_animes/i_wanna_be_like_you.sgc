``Gee, cousin Louie
You're doin' real good!''
``Now here's your part of the deal, cuz
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire''
``But I don't know how to make fire!''


Now [Cm]don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with [G7]you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come [Cm]true [G7]

Now, [Cm]give me the secret, mancub
Come on, clue me what to [G7]do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like [Cm]you [Bb7]
