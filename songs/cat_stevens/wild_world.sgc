[Am]Now that I've [D7]lost everything to [G]you
[G]You say you [C]wanna start something [F]new
[F]And it's [Dm]breaking my heart you're [E]leaving
[E]Baby, I'm grievin'
{newline}
But if you want to leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad, out [G7]there

{start_of_chorus}
  [C]Oh [G]baby, baby, it's a [Am]wild [F]world
  [G]It's hard to get [F]by, just upon a [C]smile
  [C]Oh [G]baby, baby, it's a [Am]wild [F]world
  [G]I'll always remem[F]ber you like a [C]child, girl [D E]
{end_of_chorus}

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never want to see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl
{newline}
But if you want to leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad, out there
