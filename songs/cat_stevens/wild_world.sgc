    [Am]Now that I've [D7]lost everything to [G]you
    [G]You say you [C]wanna start something [F]new
    [F]And it's [Dm]breaking my heart you're [E]leaving
    [E]Baby, I'm grievin'
  

  \begin{verse*}
    But if you want to leave, take good care
    Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
    But then a lot of nice things turn bad, out [G7]there
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C]Oh [G]baby, baby, it's a [Am]wild [F]world
    [G]{It's} hard to get [F]by, just upon a [C]smile
    [C]Oh [G]baby, baby, it's a [Am]wild [F]world
    [G]{I'll} always remem[F]ber you like a [C]child, girl [D E]
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
    And it's breaking my heart in two
    Because I never want to see you sad, girl
    Don't be a bad girl
  

  \begin{verse*}
    But if you want to leave, take good care
    Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
    But just remember there's a lot of bad, out there
  \end{verse*}
