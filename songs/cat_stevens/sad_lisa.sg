  \begin{verse}
    She \[Em]hangs her head and \[D]cries in my \[C]shirt
    \[D] She must be \[Em]hurt very \[D]bad\[G]ly
    Tell me what's \[D]making you \[Em]sad\[A]ly?
    \[Em]Open your \[A]door, don't \[D]hide in the \[C]dark
    You're \[D]lost in the \[Em]dark, you can \[D]trust \[G]me
    'cause you know that's \[D]how it must \[Em A]be
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[Em]Lisa, Li\[A]sa, sad \[B]Lisa, Li\[Em]sa
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Her eyes like windows tricklin' rain
    Upon her pain getting deeper
    Though my love wants to relieve her
    She walks alone from wall to wall
    Lost in a hall, she can't hear me
    Though I know she likes to be near me
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    She sits in a corner by the door
    There must be more I can tell her
    If she really wants me to help her
    I'll do what I can to show her the way
    And maybe one day I will free her
    Though I know no one can see her
  \end{verse}
