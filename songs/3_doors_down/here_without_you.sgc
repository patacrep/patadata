{newline}
A hundred [Am]days have made me older
Since the last[G] time that I saw your pretty face [Am F G]
A thousand [Am]lies have made me colder
And I [G]don't think I can look at this the same[Am F G]
[Am] All the miles that sepa[G]rate
[Am] Disappear now when I'm d[F]reamin' of y[G]our face

{start_of_chorus}
  [C] I'm here without you baby[G]
  But you're still on my lonely m[Am]ind
  I think about you baby
  [F]And I dream a[G]bout you all the time
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  [C] I'm here without you baby
  [G] But you're still with me in my d[Am]reams
  And t[F]onight, there's [G]only you and me
{end_of_chorus}

The [Am]miles just keep rollin'
As the [G]people leave their way to say he[Am]llo [F G]
I've heard this [Am]life is overrated
But I [G]hope that it gets better as we [Am]go [F G]

{start_of_chorus}
  [C] I'm here without you baby[G]
  But you're still on my lonely m[Am]ind
  I think about you baby
  [F]And I dream a[G]bout you all the time

  And t[F]onight, there's [G]only you and me
{end_of_chorus}

[Am] Everything I know,[C] and anywhere I go
[G] It gets hard but it won't [F]take away my love
[Am] And when the last one falls,[C] when it's all said and [G]done
It gets hard but it won't [F]take away my [F]love [C G Am F G]
