  \begin{verse}
    \[A]I heard that you're \[A&/A]settled down
    That you \[F#m]found a girl and you're \[D]married now
    \[A]I heard that your \[A&/A]dreams came true
    Guess she \[F#m]gave you things I didn't \[D]give to you
  \end{verse}
  \begin{verse*}
    Old friend, why are you so shy?
    Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{bridge}
    \[E]I hate to turn up out of the \[F#m]blue, uninvited
    But I \[D]couldn't stay away, \[D]I couldn't fight it
    \[E]I had hoped you'd see my face and \[F#m]that you'd be reminded
    That for \[D]me, it isn't \[D]over \[E*]
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[A]Never mind, I'll \[E]find someone \[F#m]like you \[D]
    I wish \[A]nothing but the \[E]best for \[F#m]you, \[D]too
    Don't \[A]forget me, I \[E]beg, I re\[F#m]member you \[D]said
    Sometimes it \[A]lasts in love, but \[E]sometimes it \[F#m]hurts instead\[D] \rep{2}

  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    You know how the time flies
    Only yesterday was the time of our lives
    We were born and raised in a summer haze
    Bound by the surprise of our glory days
  \end{verse}

    Never mind, I'll find someone like you
    I wish nothing but the best for you, too
    Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
    Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{bridge}
    \[E]Nothing compares, no \[E]worries or cares
    \[F#m]Regrets and mistakes, they're \[F#m]memories made
    \[D]Who would have known how bitter\[Bm]sweet \[Cm]this would \[D]taste?
