    [Am]There's a fire [E]starting in my heart
    [G]Reaching a fever pitch and it's [E]bringing me out the dark
    [Am]Finally, I can [E]see you crystal clear
    [G]Go ahead and sell me out and [E]{I'll} lay your ship bare
  

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    \begin{verse*}
      [Am]See how I leave with [E]every piece of you
      [G]Don't underestimate the [E]things that I will do
      [Am]There's a fire [E]starting in my heart
      [G]Reaching a fever pitch and it's [E]bringing me out the dark
    \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [F] The scars of [G]your love, remind me [Em]of us
    They keep me [F]thinking that we almost had it all
    [F] The scars of [G]your love, they leave me [Em]breathless
    I can't help [E]feeling
  {end_of_chorus}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [E] We could have had it [Am]all[G]
    Rolling in the [F]deep[G]
    Your had my heart in[Am]side of your [G]hand
    And you [F]played it to the [G]beat
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [Am]Baby I have no [E]story to be told
      But [G]{I've} heard one of you and I'm [E]gonna make your head burn
      [Am]Think of me in the [E]depths of your despair
      [G]Making a home down there, as mine [E]sure won't be shared
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [Am]Throw your soul through [E]every open door
      [G]Count your blessings to [E]find what you look for
      [Am]Turn my sorrow [E]into treasured gold
      You'll [G]pay me back in kind and [E]reap just what you've sown
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
