{guitar_comment: Intro:  [A Ab/A F#m D]}
{newline}
[A]I heard that you're [Ab/A]settled down
That you [F#m]found a girl and you're [D]married now
[A]I heard that your [Ab/A]dreams came true
Guess she [F#m]gave you things I didn't [D]give to you
{newline}
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

{start_of_bridge}
[E]I hate to turn up out of the [F#m]blue, uninvited
But I [D]couldn't stay away, [D]I couldn't fight it
[E]I had hoped you'd see my face and [F#m]that you'd be reminded
That for [D]me, it isn't [D]over [E*]
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
  [A]Never mind, I'll [E]find someone [F#m]like you [D]
  I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#m]you, [D]too
  Don't [A]forget me, I [E]beg, I re[F#m]member you [D]said
  Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it [F#m]hurts instead[D] {repeat: 2}
  [D]
{end_of_chorus}

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

{start_of_bridge}
[E]I hate to turn up out of the [F#m]blue, uninvited
But I [D]couldn't stay away, [D]I couldn't fight it
[E]I had hoped you'd see my face and [F#m]that you'd be reminded
That for [D]me, it isn't [D]over [D] [E*]
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you
  I wish nothing but the best for you, too
  Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[E]Nothing compares, no [E]worries or cares
[F#m]Regrets and mistakes, they're [F#m]memories made
[D]Who would have known how bitter[Bm]sweet [Cm]this would [D]taste?
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you
  I wish nothing but the best for you
  Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you
  I wish nothing but the best for you, too
  Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
