    \musicnote{\Intro: \nolyrics{[Am FM7 Am Am FM7 Am G F E]}}
  \end{verse*}

  
    I've always [Am]known [FM7]since I was a young boy [Am FM7]
    In this [Am]world, [FM7]everything's as good as [Am]bad
    Now my [Am]father told me [FM7]always speak a true word [Am FM7]
    And I [Am]have to say that is the [FM7]best advice I've [Am]had
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Because [Dm]something burns inside of [Am]me
    It's [Dm]everything I long to [Am]be
    And [Dm]lies they only [C]stop me from feeling [E]free
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Am]Like a hobo from a [FM7]broken home
    [G13]Nothing's gonna stop me [G14]
    [Dm]Like a hobo from a [Am]broken home
    [B7&9]Nothing's gonna stop me [E]
  {end_of_chorus}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Am]Ah ahah ahah[FM7]ah, ahah ah [Am FM7]
    [Am]Ah ahah ahah[FM7]ah, ahah ah [Am G F E]
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      I've never [Am]yearned for [FM7]anybody's fortune [Am FM7]
      The less I [Am]have the [FM7]more I am a happy [Am]man
      Now my [Am]mother told me [FM7]always keep your head on [Am FM7]
      Because [Am]some may praise you [FM7]just to get what they [Am]want
    

    \begin{verse*}
      And I said, ``[Dm]Mama, I am not a[Am]fraid
      [Dm]They will take what they will [Am]take
      And [Dm]what would life be [C]like without a few mis[E]takes''
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
