[Am]There is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans [F]
They [Am]call the [C]Rising [E7]Sun
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Am]God, I [E7]know, I'm [Am]one
[C D F Am E7 Am E7]

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one
