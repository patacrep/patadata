    [E]This day is getting ol[C#m]der
    In [G#]fading light it's [A]beautiful
    [E]This wind is blowing cold[C#m]er
    [G#]And too soon I'll feel [A]it's pull
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Still, I took all my chances
    Earned myself an even score
    Try to learn my lessons well
    And I don't have the answers
    For those questions anymore
    Only love can be both heaven and hell
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [E]So sturdy up, sturdy up your[C#m]{ heart}
    [G#]{For }the road is long ah[A]ead
    [E]I'll be with you even though we're [C#m]apart
    [G#]{But }your road is yours to [A]{tread}
    And[E]{ so it} goes, and so [C#m]{it goes}
    And so[G#]{ it }goes, slows your mind[A]{, mind}, mind
    And so [E]{it goes}, and so [C#m]{it goes}
    And so [G#]{it goes}, slows [A]{your} mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    I've grown old on this ocean
    Gave her all, my stronger years
    Gave my wife my devotion
    When she died, the ocean my tears
  

  \begin{verse*}
    I've tried to teach you well son
    All of everything I knew
    Of how to live this life be true
    Don't bow your head to no one
    And no matter what you do
    If you start then see it through
  \end{verse*}
