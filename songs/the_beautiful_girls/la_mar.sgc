[E]This day is getting ol[C#m]der
In [G#]fading light it's [A]beautiful
[E]This wind is blowing cold[C#m]er
[G#]And too soon I'll feel [A]it's pull
{newline}
Still, I took all my chances
Earned myself an even score
Try to learn my lessons well
And I don't have the answers
For those questions anymore
Only love can be both heaven and hell

{start_of_chorus}
  [E]So sturdy up, sturdy up your[C#m] heart
  [G#]For the road is long ah[A]ead
  [E]I'll be with you even though we're [C#m]apart
  [G#]But your road is yours to [A]tread
  And[E] so it goes, and so [C#m]it goes
  And so[G#] it goes, slows your mind[A], mind, mind
  And so [E]it goes, and so [C#m]it goes
  And so [G#]it goes, slows [A]your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
{end_of_chorus}

I've grown old on this ocean
Gave her all, my stronger years
Gave my wife my devotion
When she died, the ocean my tears
{newline}
I've tried to teach you well son
All of everything I knew
Of how to live this life be true
Don't bow your head to no one
And no matter what you do
If you start then see it through
