    [G]My baby don't m[C]ess around
    Because she loves me so
    And this [D]I know for s[E]ure
  

  \begin{verse*}
    But does she really wanna
    But can't stand to see me
    Walk out the door
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    I can't stand to fight the feeling
    'Cause the thought alone
    Is killing me right now
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Thank god for mom and dad
    For sticking two together
    'Cause we don't know how
  \end{verse*}

    [G]Hey [C]ya, [D]hey [E]ya \rep{2}
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    You think you've got it, oh you think you've got it
    But God just don't get it
    Till' there's nothing at all
  

  \begin{verse*}
    We get together, oh, we get together
    But separates always better
    When there's feelings involved
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    If what they say that ``nothing is forever''
    Then what makes
    What makes love the exception?
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    So why are, why are, why are, why are
    Why are we so in denial
    When we know we're not happy here?
  \end{verse*}

  
    Alright now fellas
    Yeah oh, cooler than being cool?
    I can't hear you now, now, now
  

  \begin{verse*}
    I say what's cooler than being cool?
    Alright
    What now ladies
    Yeah, we're gonna bring it down in just a few seconds here
    Now don't make me break this down for nothing
    I wanna see you all on your all's baddest behavior
    Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
    Shake it
    Shake it like a Polaroid Picture
    Oh now, shake it
    Shake it up
  \end{verse*}
