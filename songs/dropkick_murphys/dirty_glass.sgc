  \begin{verse*}
    [D]Murphy, Murphy, [G]darling [D]dear
    I [G]long for you [D]now night and [A]day
    Your [D]pain was my pleasure, your [G]sorrow my [D]joy
    I [G]feel now I've [D]lost you to [A]health and good [D]cheer
  \end{verse*}

  
    [G]Darcy, when I met you I was [D]five years too [A]young
    A [D]boy beyond his [G]age, or so I'd [A]tell some[D]one
    [Bm]Anyone who'd listen and a [G]few who couldn't care
    Still I [D]welcomed you with [G]open arms, my [A]love I did [D]share
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [D]Darcy, Darcy [G]darling dear
    You [D]left me dying, [A]crying there
    In [D]whiskey, gin, and [G]pints of beer
    I [A]fell for you my [D]darling dear
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    You shut me off and you showed me the door
    But you always came crawling back begging me for more
    I showed you kindness, a stool, and a tab
    Then you poured me my pain in a dirty glass
  

  \begin{verse*}
    \echo{Yeah, you left him bloody, battered, penniless, and poor}
    You know, I often stopped and wondered how you made it through my door
    With my brother's new non-duplicate registry ID
    Well you bit off more than you could chew the first day you met me
  \end{verse*}


  
    You weren't the first to court me mister you won't be the last
    Oh, sure I wasn't honey, I know all about your past
    Listen to the big shot with his pager on call
    You spent most of those nights in my bathroom stall
  

  \begin{verse*}
    \echo{Yeah, you got him high, but you left him low}
    Mind you own business, boy, how was I to know
    That he was just a fiend and a no-good cheat
    Well it's all in the past bitch 'cause now I've got it beat
  \end{verse*}
