    [F#5]{I walk} a [A5]lonely road
    [E5]The only one [B5]that I have
    [F#5]Ever known. Don't know [A5]where it goes
    [E5]But it's home to me [B5]and I walk
    [F#5]Alone [A5] [E5] [B5]
  

  
    I walk this empty street
    On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
    Where the city sleeps
    And I'm the only one and I walk
    Alone
  

  \begin{verse*}
    I [A5]walk alone, I [E5]walk alone
    I [B5]walk alone, I walk a~\dots
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [D5]My [A5]shadow's [E5]the only one [B5]that walks beside me
    [D5]My [A5]shallow [E5]heart's the [B5]only thing that's beating
    [D5]Some[A5]times [E5]{I wish} someone [B5]out there will find me
    [D5]'Til [A5]then [C#5]{I walk} alone
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{verse*}
    Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah
    Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah
  \end{verse*}

  
    I'm walking down the line
    That divides me somewhere in
    My mind. On the border line
    Of the edge and where I walk
    Alone
  

  
    Read between the lines
    What's fucked up and everything's
    Alright. Check my vital signs
    To know I'm still alive and I walk
    Alone
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah
    Ah-ah, Ah-ah
  \end{verse*}

  
    I walk this empty street
    On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
    Where the city sleeps
    And I'm the only one and I walk
    A~\dots
