    Vir[B&m]ginia was a lot lizard from F.L.A.~
    She had a compound fracture in the [F]trunk
    It [B&m]started when she ran away
    [E&m]Thumbs out on the [F#]interstate
    She [F]hitched a ride to mise[B&m]ry
  

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      Mr. [B&m]Whirly had a catastrophic incident
      He fell into the city by the [F]bay
      He [B&m]liquidated his estate
      [E&m]Now he sleeps upon the [F#]Haight
      [F]Panhandling mise[B&m]ry
    
  \end{repeatedchords}

  {start_of_chorus}
    And he's gonna get [F]high, high, high
    When he's [B&m]low, low, low
    The [F]fire burns from better [B&m]days
    And she screams, {\og}[F]Why, oh why ?{\fg}
    I said, {\og}[B&m]{I don't} know{\fg}
    The [E&m]catastrophic [F#]hymns from yester[F]day
    Of mise[B&m]ry
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [B&m]Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
      He ran the drug cartel in Tinsel [F]town
      They [B&m]found him in a cadillac
      [E&m]Bludgeoned with a [F#]baseball bat
      [F]In the name of mise[B&m]ry
    

    
      [B&m]Gina hit the road to New York City
      Mysteriously the night Vinnie [F]croaked
      She [B&m]stopped in Vegas to elope
      [E&m]With Virginia [F#]and the dope
      And [F]kissed the bride eternal[B&m]ly
    


    {start_of_chorus}
      And they're gonna get [F]high, high, high
      When they're [B&m]low, low, low
      The [F]fire burns from better [B&m]days
      And she screams, {\og}[F]Why, oh why ?{\fg}
      I said, {\og}[B&m]{I don't} know{\fg}
      The [E&m]catastrophic [F#]hymns from yester[F]day
      Of mise[B&m]ry
    {end_of_chorus}
  \end{repeatedchords}

  \begin{bridge}
    [F#]Hell hounds on your [F]trail now once a[B&m]gain boy
    It's [F#]groping on your [F]leg until it [B&m]sleeps
    The [F#]emptiness will [F]fill your soul with [B&m]sorrow
    'Cause [F#]{it's} not what you make, it's what you [F]leave
  \end{bridge}


  {start_of_chorus}
    And we're gonna get [F]high, high, high
    When we're [B&m]low, low, low
    The [F]fire burns from better [B&m]days
    And she screams, {\og}[F]Why, oh why ?{\fg}
    I said, {\og}[B&m]{I don't} know{\fg}
    The [E&m]catastrophic [F#]hymns from yester[F]day
    Of mise[B&m]ry
