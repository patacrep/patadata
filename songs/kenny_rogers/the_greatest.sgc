    [D]Little boy, in a baseball hat
    Stands [A]in the field, with his [G]ball and [D]bat
    [D]Says, ``I am the greatest, player of them all''
    Puts his [A]bat on his shoulder, and he [G]tosses up his [D]ball
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    And the [A]ball goes up, and the ball comes down
    [G]Swings his bat all the [D]way around
    The [A]world's so still you can hear the sound
    The [G]baseball falls{\dots} to the ground [D]
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Now the little boy, doesn't say a word
    Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
    Says, ``I am the greatest, there has ever been''
    And he grits his teeth, and he tries it again
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    And the ball goes up, and the ball comes down
    Swings his bat all the way around
    The world's so still you can hear the sound
    The baseball falls{\dots} to the ground
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{bridge}
    He [Bm]makes no excuses, he [G]shows no fear
    He just [D]closes his eyes, and [A]listens to the cheers
  \end{bridge}

  
    Little boy, he adjusts his hat
    Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
    Says, ``I am the greatest, the game is on the line''
    And he gives his all, one last time
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    And the ball goes up, like the moon so bright
    Swings his bat with all his might
    And the world's so still as still can be
    And the baseball falls{\dots} that's strike three
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Now it's supper time, and his mama calls
    Little boy starts home, with his bat and ball
    Says, ``I am the greatest, that is a fact
    But even I didn't know, I could pitch like that''
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Says, ``I am the greatest, that is understood
    But even I didn't know, I could pitch that good''
  \end{verse*}
