[G]If you didn't [C]care [Csus4 C]
what happened to [G]me [Gsus4 G]
And I didn't [C]care [Csus4 C]
For [G]you [Gsus4 G]
We would [A]zig-zag our way [A]
Through the [A7]boredom and pain
[G]Occasionally [C]glancing [D]up through the [G]rain [Am]
Wondering [F]
Which of the [Am]buggers to [F]blame[C Am7/B Am]
And [D]watching[Dsus4 D]
[D]For pigs on the [G]wing
