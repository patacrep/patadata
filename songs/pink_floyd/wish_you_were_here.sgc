    [C]So, so you think you can te[D]ll
    Heaven from He[Am]ll
  Blue Skies from pai[G]n
  Can you tell a green fi[D]eld
  From a cold steel ra[C]il
  A smile from a ve[Am]il
    Do you think you can [G]tell
    Did they get you to tra[C]de
  Your heroes for ghos[D]ts
  Hot Ashes for tre[Am]es
  Hot air for a [G]cool breeze
  Cold comfort for [D]change
  Did you ex[C]change ?
  A walk on part in the [Am]war
  For a lead role in a [G]cage

    [C]How I wish, how I wish you were [D]here
  We're just [Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl [G]
  Year after year [D]
  Running over the same old ground [C]
  What have we found the same old [Am]fears
  Wish you were [G]here\dots
