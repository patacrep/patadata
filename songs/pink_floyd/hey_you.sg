  \begin{verse}
    Hey \[Em*]you! out there in the cold
    Getting lonely getting old, can you \[Bm*]feel me
    Hey \[Em*]you! Standing in the aisles
    With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you \[Bm*]feel me
    \[D*] Hey you! don't help them to bury the l\[G*]\[D*]i\[C*]ght
    \[Bm] Don't give in \[Am] without a f\[Em]ight
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Hey \[Em]you! out there on your own
    Sitting naked by the phone would you \[Bm]touch me
    Hey \[Em]you! with your ear against the wall
    Waiting for someone to call out would you \[Bm]touch me
    \[D] Hey you! would you help me to carry the st\[G]\[D]o\[C]ne
    \[Bm]Open your heart \[Am] I'm coming \[Em]home
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[C] But it was \[D]only a \[G]fan\[D]ta\[C]sy
    The wall was too high as \[G]you \[D]can \[C]see
    No matter how he tr\[D]ied he could \[G]not \[D]break \[C]free
    And the worms ate \[D*]into his \[Em*]brain \[Dm*]
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Hey \[Em*]you! out there on the road
    Always doing what you're told, can you \[Bm*]help me
    Hey \[Em*]you! out there beyond the wall
    Breaking bottles in the hall, can you \[Bm*]help me
    \[D*] Hey you! don't tell me there's no hope at \[G**]\[D*]a\[C*]ll
    \[Bm]Together we stand \[Am] divided we f\[Em]all
  \end{verse}
