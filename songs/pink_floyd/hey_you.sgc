    Hey [Em*]you! out there in the cold
    Getting lonely getting old, can you [Bm*]feel me
    Hey [Em*]you! Standing in the aisles
    With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you [Bm*]feel me
    [D*] Hey you! don't help them to bury the l[G*][D*]i[C*]ght
    [Bm] Don't give in [Am] without a f[Em]ight
  

  
    Hey [Em]you! out there on your own
    Sitting naked by the phone would you [Bm]touch me
    Hey [Em]you! with your ear against the wall
    Waiting for someone to call out would you [Bm]touch me
    [D] Hey you! would you help me to carry the st[G][D]o[C]ne
    [Bm]Open your heart [Am] I'm coming [Em]home

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C] But it was [D]only a \meter{2}{4}|[G]fan[D]ta\meter{4}{4}|[C]sy
    The wall was too high as \meter{2}{4}|[G]you [D]can \meter{4}{4}|[C]see
    No matter how he tr[D]ied he could \meter{2}{4}|[G]not [D]break \meter{4}{4}|[C]free
    And the worms ate [D*]into his [Em*]brain [Dm*]
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Hey [Em*]you! out there on the road
    Always doing what you're told, can you [Bm*]help me
    Hey [Em*]you! out there beyond the wall
    Breaking bottles in the hall, can you [Bm*]help me
    [D*] Hey you! don't tell me there's no hope at [G**][D*]a[C*]ll
    [Bm]Together we stand [Am] divided we f[Em]all
