  \end{verse*}

  
    As I rea[GM7]ch for a peach slide a ride down behind the sofa in San Tropez[Gm6]
    [Gm6]Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan[Gm6]
  [G7]Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness [A7]scratched by the sand that fell from our
  [C7]deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling
  [D]If you're alone I'll come home
  

\begin{repeatedchords}
  
    [GM7]Backwards and home-bound the pigeon, the dove [Gm6]gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
  [GM7]Owning a home with no silver spoon I'm [Gm6]drinking champagne like a big tycoon
  [G7]Sooner than wait for a break in the weather I'll [A7]gather my far-flung thoughts together
  [C7]Speeding away on a wind to a new day
  [D]If you're alone I'll come home
  

  
    [GM7]And I pause for a while by a country stile and listen to things they [Gm6]say
  [GM7]Digging for gold with a hoe in my hand hoping they'll take a look at the way things [Gm6]stand
  [G7]Would you lead me down to the place by the sea ? [A7]I hear your soft voice calling to me
  [C7]Making a date for later by phone
  [D]If you're alone I'll come home
  
\end{repeatedchords}
