    [Bm]Hello
    Is there anybody [A]in there?
    Just nod if you can [G]hear me [Em]
    Is there [Bm]anyone home?
  

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [Bm]Come on now
      I hear you're[A] feeling down
      Well [G]I can ease your [Em]pain
      And [Bm]get you on your feet again
    

    
      [Bm]Relax
      I'll need some inform[A]ation first
      [G]Just the basic f[Em]acts
      Can you [Bm]show me where it hurts?
    
  \end{repeatedchords}

    [D] There is no pain you are [A]receding
    [D] A distant ship's smoke on the [A]horizon
    [C] You are only coming through in [G]waves
    Your [C]lips move but I can't hear what you're s[G]aying
    When [D]I was a child I had a f[A]ever
    My [D]hands felt just like two ball[A]oons
    [C] Now I've got that feeling once ag[G]ain
    I can't explain you would not [C]understand
    This is not how I [G]am
    [A]I [C] have bec[G]ome comfortably nu[D]mb

      [Bm]O.K
      Just a little [A]pinprick
      There'll be no more [G]Aaaaa[Em]h
      But you [Bm]may feel a little sick
    

    
      Can you st[Bm]and up?
      I do believe it's w[A]orking good
      That'll keep you g[G]oing through the sh[Em]ow
      Co[Bm]me on it's time to go

      [C] You are only coming through in [G]waves
      Your [C]lips move but I can't hear what you're s[G]aying
      When [D]I was a child I caught a fl[A]eeting glimpse
      [D] Out of the corner of my ey[A]e
      [C] I turned to look but it was g[G]one
      I cannot put my finger [C]on it now
      The child is grown the dr[G]eam is gone
      [A]I [C] have bec[G]ome comfortably nu[D]mb
