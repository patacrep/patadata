[Bm]Hello
Is there anybody [A]in there?
Just nod if you can [G]hear me [Em]
Is there [Bm]anyone home?

[Bm]Come on now
I hear you're[A] feeling down
Well [G]I can ease your [Em]pain
And [Bm]get you on your feet again

[Bm]Relax
I'll need some inform[A]ation first
[G]Just the basic f[Em]acts
Can you [Bm]show me where it hurts?

{start_of_chorus}
  [D] There is no pain you are [A]receding
  [D] A distant ship's smoke on the [A]horizon
  [C] You are only coming through in [G]waves
  Your [C]lips move but I can't hear what you're s[G]aying
  When [D]I was a child I had a f[A]ever
  My [D]hands felt just like two ball[A]oons
  [C] Now I've got that feeling once ag[G]ain
  I can't explain you would not [C]understand
  This is not how I [G]am
  [A]I [C] have bec[G]ome comfortably nu[D]mb

{end_of_chorus}

[Bm]O.K
Just a little [A]pinprick
There'll be no more [G]Aaaaa[Em]h
But you [Bm]may feel a little sick

Can you st[Bm]and up?
I do believe it's w[A]orking good
That'll keep you g[G]oing through the sh[Em]ow
Co[Bm]me on it's time to go

  [D] There is no pain you are [A]receding
  [D] A distant ship's smoke on the [A]horizon
  [C] You are only coming through in [G]waves
  Your [C]lips move but I can't hear what you're s[G]aying
  When [D]I was a child I caught a fl[A]eeting glimpse
  [D] Out of the corner of my ey[A]e
  [C] I turned to look but it was g[G]one
  I cannot put my finger [C]on it now
  The child is grown the dr[G]eam is gone
  [A]I [C] have bec[G]ome comfortably nu[D]mb
