[C]Here's a little song I wrote
[G]You might want to sing it note for note
Don't [F]worry,[Fm G] be [C]happy [G]

In every life we have some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy {echo: be happy now}

{start_of_chorus}
  [C]Uh uh uh uh uh
  Uh uh uh uh [G]uh uh uh
  Don't worry
  Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
  Be happy
  Uh uh uh uh [C]uh
  Don't worry, be happy
{end_of_chorus}
