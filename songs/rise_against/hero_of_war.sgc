    He said, ``[E]Son
    Have you see the [G#m]world?
    Well, what would you [A]say
    If I said that you [E]could?
    Just carry this [A]gun
    And you'll even get [E]paid''
    I said, ``That sounds pretty [B]good''
  

  
    Black leather boots
    Spit-shined so bright
    They cut off my hair
    But it looked alright
    We marched and we sang
    We all became friends
    As we learned how to fight
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    A hero of [C#m]war
    Yeah that's what I'[A]ll be
    And when I come [E]home
    They'll be damn proud of [B]me
    I'll carry this [C#m]flag
    To the grave if I [A]must
    Because it's flag that [E]I love
    And a flag that I [B]trust

    I kicked in the door
    I yelled my commands
    The children, they cried
    But I got my man
    We took him away
    A bag over his face
    From his family and his friends
  

  
    They took off his clothes
    They pissed in his hands
    I told them to stop
    But then I joined in
    We beat him with guns
    And batons not just once
    But again and again
  

  
    She walked
    Through bullets and haze
    I asked her to stop
    I begged her to stay
    But she pressed on
    So I lifted my gun
    And I fired away
  

  
    The shells
    Jumped through the smoke
    And into the sand
    That the blood now had soaked
    She collapsed
    With a flag in her hand
    A flag white as snow
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    A hero of war
    Is that what they see
    Just medals and scars
    So damn proud of me
    And I brought home that flag
    Now it gathers dust
    But it's a flag that I love
    It's the only flag I trust
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    He said, ``Son
    Have you seen the world?
    Well what would you say
    If I said that you could?''
