    [C]{I am} not gonna [Am]make it
    [C]{I can} see the crowd a[Am]round me
    Is getting [G]bigger and as it is
    I'm trying to fi[Dm]gure out
    Why [F]{I feel} [G]so iso[C]lated
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [C]{I have} my [Am]friends
    But don't have much time for [C]them
    [C]{I have} my [Am]house
    A tiny pocket in my [G]luggage
    I have my [Dm]boyfriend
    But he's also so [F]tired of listening [G]to me [C]
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    [C]Every single [Am]day
    Seems like a mountain to [C]climb
    Every single [Am]word
    It takes all my strength to [G]get it out
    I'm tired of [Dm]talking about me
    But in fact, it's the [F]only thing I get a [G]grip on
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    [C]{I feel} [Am]like I'm not gonna make it
    [C]{I really} feel [Am]like I'm not gonna make [G]it
    But it [Dm]might be the best thing
    That ever happened [F]to me, so [G]now
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C]Hey, little girl keep on [Em]smiling
    'Cause they don't want to [Dm]hear you complaining
    You're a [F]lucky girl, your life's [G]so exciting [C]
    So I'll [C]keep on making bad [Em]jokes
    'Cause you think I'm st[Dm]rong
    And it might be the way you like [F]it
    Oh how I [G]need you to like [C]me?
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [C]{I have} tried as hard as [Am]{I can}
      [C]{I have} tried to [Am]go through 9 to 5
      But I was like a [G]train
      Between work and [Dm]bars
      Never found out [F]what I was [G]travelling for [C]
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [C]Now I have my [Am]car
      But I ain't got no safe place to [C]go
      [C]{I still} hold my [Am]drink
      But I'm not as [Am]thirsty as be[G]fore
      I have my [Dm]voice but I heard lately that people
      [F]Don't want to hear sad [G]songs [C]
    \end{verse*}

    \begin{verse*}
      [C]Every single [Am]place
      It's all the same to [C]me
      Every single [Am]face
      I know it will be re[G]placed
      By another smiley [Dm]one
      Who will also be left soon [F]somewhere be[G]hind
    \end{verse*}

    \begin{verse*}
      [C]I feel [Am]like I'm not gonna make it
      [C]I really feel [Am]like I'm not gonna make [G]it
      But it [Dm]might be the best thing
      That ever happened [F]to me, so [G]now
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}

  
    [C]Please now just don't count on [Em]me
    I can't handle it any[Dm]more
    And don't ask me why
    If you don't want me to [C]lie
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [C]But don't be a[Em]larmed
    Don't you see that I'm just [Dm]down
    Just [F]{don't} worry soon
    I'll be [G]back on the tracks
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C]Smiling!'Cause I'll get tired of com[Em]plaining
    I'm a [F]lucky girl and I'm [G]doing exactly what I wanted
    So I'll [C]keep on making bad [Em]jokes
    'Cause I need to be [Dm]strong
    It might be my only chance to get out of [F]it
    And now I [G]really need to [C]make it
  {end_of_chorus}
