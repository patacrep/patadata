Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you've got me blinded
{newline}
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
{newline}
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby, cuz I need to know now
That's because

Oh baby baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
{newline}
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killin' me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
To give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
