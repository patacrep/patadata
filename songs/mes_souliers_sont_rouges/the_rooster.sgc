We had some [C]chickens
No eggs would they [G7]lay
We had some chickens
No eggs would they [C]lay[C7]
The wife said, ``[F]Honey
We're losing [C]money (oh yeah)
Because that [G7]chickens
No eggs would they [C]lay''[C7]

{start_of_chorus}
  Then came a [F]rooster
  Into her [C]yard
  And he caught that [G7]chickens
  Right off of their [C]guards[C7]
  They 're laying [F]eggs now
  Like they never [C]used to
  Since that [G7]rooster
  Came into her [C]yard

We had a moo-cow
No milk would she give
We had a moo-cow
No milk would she give
The wife said, ``Honey
We're losing money
Because that moo-cow
No milk would she gives''

{start_of_chorus}
  Then came a rooster
  Into her yard
  And he caught that moo-cow
  Right off of her guards
  She 's giving yogurts
  Like she never used to
  Since that rooster
  Came into her yard
{end_of_chorus}

We had an elephant
No tusk would he grow
We had an elephant
No tusk would he grow
The wife said, ``Honey
We're losing money
Because that elephant
No tusk would he grow''

{start_of_chorus}
  Then came a rooster
  Into her yard
  And he caught that elephant
  Right off of his guards
  He's laying eggs now
  Of a solid ivory
  Since that rooster
  Came into her yard
{end_of_chorus}

We had a rooster
He was awfully gay
We had a rooster
He was funny that way
The wife said, ``Honey
We're losing money
Because that rooster
Was funny that way''

{start_of_chorus}
  Then came a chicken
  Into her yard
  And he caught that rooster
  Right off of his guards
  He's laying eggs now
  Like he never used to
  Since that chicken
  Came into her yard
{end_of_chorus}
