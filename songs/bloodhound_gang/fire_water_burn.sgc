    \begin{verse*}
      Yeah, I'm [G]hung like planet Pluto hard to [Em]see with the naked eye
      But if I [G]crashed into Uranus I would [Em]stick it where the sun don't shine
      Cause I'm [G]kinda like Han Solo always [Em]struck in my own wookie
      I'm the [D]root of all that's evil, yeah, but [C]you can call me cookie

      [G] This honkey's [Em]gone to heaven
    

    \begin{verse*}
      But if [G]{I go} to hell then I [Em]hope I burn well
      I'll spend my [G]days with J.F.K., Marvin Gaye, Martha [Em]Raye, and Lawrence Welk
      And Kurt Co[G]bain, Kojak, Mark Twain and Jimi [Em]Hendrix's poltergeist
      And [D]Webster yeah Emmanuel Lewis cause [C]{he's} the anti-christ
    \end{verse*}
