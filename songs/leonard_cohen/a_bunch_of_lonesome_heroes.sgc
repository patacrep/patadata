    [A] A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome [Bm]heroes
    [E] Were smoking [E7]out along the open [A]road[Asus4 A]
    The night was very dark and thick bet[Bm]ween them
    [E] Each man be[E7]neath his ordinary [A]load[Asus4 A]
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [D Dmaj7] [Bm]``I'd like to [D]tell my [A]story''[Amaj7 F#m A]
    [B] Said one of them so young and [E]bold [E7]
    [D] ``I'd [Dmaj7]like to [Bm]tell [D] my [A]story[Amaj7 F#m A]
    [F#m] Before I turn into gold''[E Esus4 E E7]

      [A] But no one really could [Bm]hear him
      [E] The night so [E7]dark and thick and [A]green[Asus4 A]
      Well, I guess that these heroes must always [Bm]live there
      [E] Where you and [E7]{I have} only [A]been[Asus4 A]
    

    {start_of_chorus}
      [D Dmaj7] [Bm]Put out your [D]cigarette, [A]my love[Amaj7 F#m A]
      [B] You've been alone too [E]long [E7]
      [D] And [Dmaj7]{some of us} [Bm] are[D] very hungry now[Amaj7 F#m A]
      [F#m] To hear what it is you've done that was so wrong[E Esus4 E E7]
    {end_of_chorus}

    
      [A] I sing this for the [Bm]crickets
      [E] I sing this [E7] for the [A]army[Asus4 A]
      I sing this for your [Bm]children
      [E] And for all [E7] who do not [A]need me[Asus4 A]
    

    {start_of_chorus}
      [D Dmaj7] [Bm]``I'd like to [D]tell my [A]story''[Amaj7 F#m A]
      [B] Said one of them so [E]bold [E7]
      [D] ``Oh yes, [Dmaj7]{I'd like to} [Bm]tell [D] my [A Amaj7]sto[F#m]ry [A]
      [F#m] 'cause you know I feel I'm turning into [E]go[Esus4 E E7]ld'' [A]
