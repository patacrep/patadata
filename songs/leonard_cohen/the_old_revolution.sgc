[E] I finally [A] broke into the [E]prison
[B] I found my place in the [E]chain [E7]
[A] Even damnation is [E]poisoned with [Am]rainbows
[E] All the brave young men
[G#] They're waiting now to see a sig[C#m]nal
Which some [A]killer will be [F#]lighting for [B]pay [B7]

{start_of_chorus}
  [A] Into this furnace I [E]ask you now to [Am]venture
  [E]You whom I [B7]cannot be[A]tray [A E]
{end_of_chorus}

[E] I fought in the [A]old revo[E]lution
[B] On the side of the ghost and the [E]King [E7]
[A] Of course I was very young and I [E]thought that we were [Am]winning
[E] I can't pretend
[G#] I still feel very much like sin[C#m]ging
As they [A]carry the [F#]bodies a[B]way [B7]

[E] Lately you've [A]started to [E]stutter
[B] As though you had nothing to [E]say [E7]
[A] To all of my architects [E]let me be [Am]traitor
[E] Now let me say
[G#] I myself gave the or[C#m]der
To [A]sleep and to [F#]search and to des[B]troy [B7]

[E] Yes, you who are [A]broken by [E]power
[B] You who are absent all [E]day [E7]
[A] You who are kings for the sake of your [E]children's [Am]story
[E] The hand of your beggar
[G#] Is burdened down with mo[C#m]ney
The [A]hand of your [F#]lover is [B]clay [B7]
