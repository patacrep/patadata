    [E] I finally [A] broke into the [E]prison
    [B] I found my place in the [E]chain [E7]
    [A] Even damnation is [E]poisoned with [Am]rainbows
    [E] All the brave young men
    [G#] They're waiting now to see a sig[C#m]nal
    Which some [A]killer will be [F#]lighting for [B]pay [B7]
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [A] Into this furnace I [E]ask you now to [Am]venture
    [E]You whom I [B7]cannot be[A]tray [A E]

      [E] I fought in the [A]old revo[E]lution
      [B] On the side of the ghost and the [E]King [E7]
      [A] Of course I was very young and I [E]thought that we were [Am]winning
      [E] I can't pretend
      [G#] I still feel very much like sin[C#m]ging
      As they [A]carry the [F#]bodies a[B]way [B7]
    

    
      [E] Lately you've [A]started to [E]stutter
      [B] As though you had nothing to [E]say [E7]
      [A] To all of my architects [E]{let me} be [Am]traitor
      [E] Now let me say
      [G#] I myself gave the or[C#m]der
      To [A]sleep and to [F#]search and to des[B]troy [B7]
    

    
      [E] Yes, you who are [A]broken by [E]power
      [B] You who are absent all [E]day [E7]
      [A] You who are kings for the sake of your [E]children's [Am]story
      [E] The hand of your beggar
      [G#] Is burdened down with mo[C#m]ney
      The [A]hand of your [F#]lover is [B]clay [B7]
