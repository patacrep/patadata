[Eb]If it be your [Fm]will
[C#]That I speak no [Cm]more
[Eb]And my voice be [Fm]still
[Ab]As it was be[Eb]fore

{start_of_chorus}
  [Cm]I will speak no [Bb]more
  I [Cm]shall abide un[Bb]til
  [Ab]I am spoken [Eb]for
  If it [Bb]be your will
{end_of_chorus}

If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you

{start_of_chorus}
  From this broken hill
  All your praises they shall ring
  If it be your will
  To let me sing
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  From this broken hill
  All your praises they shall ring
  If it be your will
  To let me sing
{end_of_chorus}

If it be your will
If there is a choice
Let the rivers fill
Let the hills rejoice

{start_of_chorus}
  Let your mercy spill
  On all these burning hearts in hell
  If it be your will
  To make us well
{end_of_chorus}

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light

{start_of_chorus}
  In our rags of light
  All dressed to kill
  And end this night
  If it be your will {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}
