Suz[E]anne takes you down
To her place near the river
You can [F#m]hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
{newline}
And you [E]know that she's half crazy
But that's why you wanna be there
And she [G#m]feeds you tea and oranges
That come [A]all the way from China
{newline}
And [E]just when you mean to tell her
That you [F#m]have no love to give her
Then she [E]gets you on her wavelength
And she [F#m]lets the river answer that you've al[E]ways been her lover

{start_of_chorus}
  And you [G#m]want to travel with her
  And you [A]want to travel blind
  And you [E]know that she will trust you
  For you've [F#m]touched her perfect body with your [E]mind
{end_of_chorus}

And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
{newline}
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, ``All men will be sailors
Then until the sea shall free them''
{newline}
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

{start_of_chorus}
  And you want to travel with him
  And you want to travel blind
  And you think maybe you'll trust him
  For he's touched your perfect body with his mind
{end_of_chorus}

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
{newline}
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
{newline}
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever while Suzanne holds the mirror

{start_of_chorus}
  And you want to travel with her
  And you want to travel blind
  And you know that you can trust her
  For she's touched your perfect body with her mind
{end_of_chorus}
