    [Am]Once [G]there was this kid[C] who
    [F]Got into an [C]accident and [G]couldn't come to [C]school
    But [F]when he finally [G]came [C]back
    [G]His [C]hair [F]had turned from [C]black into bright[G] white
    He [A&]said that it was [C]from when
    The [A&]cars had smashed [C4]so [F]hard

    Then there was this girl who
    Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    But when they finally made her
    They saw birthmarks all over her body
    She couldn't quite explain it
    They'd always just been there
  

  \begin{bridge}
    [Dm]Both girl and[C] boy were [G]glad
    [Dm]One kid had it [C]worse than [G]that
  \end{bridge}

  
    'Cause then there was a boy whose
    Parents made him come right home directly after school
    And when they went to their church
    They shook and lurched all over the church floor
    He couldn't quite explain it
    They'd always just gone there
