{guitar_comment: Intro: [G D4 Em D D4 G]}
{newline}
[G]Step one you say we [D4]need to talk
He w[Em]alks you say sit do[D]wn it's j[D4]ust a ta[G]lk
He smiles pol[D4]itely back to y[Em]ou
You stare pol[D]itely ri[D4]ght on thr[G]ough
Some sort of wi[D4]ndow to your r[Em]ight
As he goes le[D]ft and y[D4]ou stay ri[G]ght
Between the li[D4]nes of fear and b[Em]lame
And you begin to wo[D]nder w[D4]hy you came

{start_of_chorus}
  Wh[C]ere did I go w[D]rong, I lost a fr[Em]iend
  Somewhere al[G]ong in the bit[D4]terness
  And [C]I would have stayed [D]up with you all n[Em]ight
  Had I known h[G]ow to save a l[D4]ife
{end_of_chorus}

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray the God he hears you
And pay the God he hears you

{guitar_comment: Chorus}

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

{guitar_comment: Chorus {repeat: 3}}
