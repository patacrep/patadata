[C]I like a [G]girl with a [F]dirty mouth
[C]Someone that I can be[G]lieve
[C]We had a [G]window not [F]open too long
But [C]that time is [G]good and [C]gone

{start_of_chorus}
  And if I ever [G]see her a[Am]gain
  She's walking [Dm]by with some new [F]guy [G]
  I know that we will [G]need to pre[Am]tend
  And hope our [Dm]eyes keep telling [F]lies [G]
{end_of_chorus}

Sit on the back porch and wonder about her
What is she doing right now?
Making somebody a happier man
Dying her hair back to brown

Once in a while your life gets so good
Worth all the trouble of the past?
That was the case but I think I always knew
Good things don't ever last

I like a girl with a dirty mouth
Know that I can trust her
We had our time but it didn't last too long
And that time is good and gone {repeat: 3}
