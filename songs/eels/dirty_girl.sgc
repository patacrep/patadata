    [C]{I like} a [G]girl with a [F]dirty mouth
    [C]Someone that I can be[G]lieve
    [C]We had a [G]window not [F]open too long
    But [C]that time is [G]good and [C]gone
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    And if I ever [G]see her a[Am]gain
    She's walking [Dm]{by with} some new [F]guy [G]
    I know that we will [G]need to pre[Am]tend
    And hope our [Dm]eyes keep telling [F]lies [G]
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Sit on the back porch and wonder about her
    What is she doing right now?
    Making somebody a happier man
    Dying her hair back to brown
  

  
    Once in a while your life gets so good
    Worth all the trouble of the past?
    That was the case but I think I always knew
    Good things don't ever last
  

  
    I like a girl with a dirty mouth
    Know that I can trust her
    We had our time but it didn't last too long
    And that time is good and gone \rep{3}
