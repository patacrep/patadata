    [D]{I can't} look at the [C]rocket [G]launch
    The [D]trophy wives of the [C]astro[G]nauts
    And [D]{I won't} listen [C]{to their} [G]words
    'cause [D]{I like} [C] [G]birds
  

  
    I don't care for walkin' downtown
    Crazy auto-car gonna mow me down
    Look at all the people like cows in a herd
    Well, I like birds
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [D]{If you're} small and [C]{on a} [G]search
    [D]I've got a feeder for [C]you to [G]perch on
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    I can't stand in line at the store
    The mean little people are such a bore
    But it's alright if you act like a turd
    'cause I like birds
