    A[Am]las, my love, ye [G]do me wrong

    And [Am]{I have} loved [G]you so long
    De[Am]lighting [E]in your [Am]companie
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C]Greensleeves was [G]all my joy

    [C]Greensleeves was my [G]heart of gold
    And [Am]who but [E]Ladie [Am]Greensleeves

      I [Am]have been readie [G]at your hand
      To [Am]grant what ever [E]you would crave
      I [Am]have both waged [G]life and land
      Your [Am]love and [E]good will [Am]for to have
    

    
      I [Am]bought thee kerchers [G]to thy head
      That [Am]were wrought fine and [E]gallantly
      I [Am]kept thee both at [G]boord and bed
      Which [Am]cost my [E]purse well [Am]favouredly
    

    
      I [Am]bought thee peticotes [G]of the best
      The [Am]cloth so fine as [E]fine might be
      I [Am]gave thee jewels [G]for thy chest
      And [Am]all this [E]cost I [Am]spent on thee
    

    
      Thy [Am]smock of silke, both [G]faire and white
      With [Am]gold embrodered [E]gorgeously
      Thy [Am]peticote of [G]sendall right
      And [Am]this I [E]bought thee [Am]gladly
    

    
      Thy [Am]girdle of gold [G]so red
      With [Am]pearles bed[E]ecked sumtuously
      The [Am]like no other [G]lasses had
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldest not [Am]love me
    

    
      Thy [Am]purse, and eke thy gay [G]guilt knives
      Thy [Am]pincase, gallant [E]to the eie
      No [Am]better wore the [G]burgesse wives
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      Thy [Am]crimson stockings, [G]all of silk
      With [Am]golde all [E]wrought above the knee
      Thy [Am]pumps, as white as [G]was the milk
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      Thy [Am]gown was of the [G]grassie green
      Thy [Am]sleeves of satten [E]hanging by
      Which [Am]made thee be our [G]harvest queen
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      Thy [Am]garters fringed [G]with the golde
      And [Am]silver aglets [E]hanging by
      Which [Am]made thee blithe for [G]to beholde
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      My gayest gelding I thee gave
      To ride where ever liked thee
      No ladie ever was so brave
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
      And yet thou wouldst not love me
    

    
      My [Am]men were clothed [G]all in green
      And [Am]they did ever [E]wait on thee
      All [Am]this was gallant [G]to be seen
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      They [Am]set thee up, they [G]took thee downe
      They [Am]served thee with hu[E]militie
      Thy [Am]foote might not once [G]touch the ground
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      For [Am]everie morning, [G]when thou rose
      I [Am]sent thee dainties, [E]orderly
      To [Am]cheare thy stomack from [G]all woes
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      Thou [Am]couldst desire no [G]earthly thing
      But [Am]stil thou hadst it [E]readily
      Thy [Am]musicke still to [G]play and sing
      And [Am]yet thou [E]wouldst not [Am]love me
    

    
      And [Am]who did pay for [G]all this geare
      That [Am]thou didst spend when [E]pleased thee?
      Even [Am]{I that} am re[G]jected here
      And [Am]thou dis[E]dainst to [Am]love me
    

    
      Wei, [Am]{I wil} pray to [G]God on hie
      That [Am]thou my constancie [E]maist see
      And [Am]that yet once be[G]fore I die
      Thou [Am]will vouch[E]safe to [Am]love me
    

    {start_of_chorus}
      [C]Greensleeves, now [G]farewel, adue!
      [Am]God I pray to [E]prosper thee
      [C]For I am stil thy [G]lover true
