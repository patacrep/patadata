This was a [A]triumph. [F#m A]
I'm [F#m]making a [A]note here:
[F#m]HUGE SUCC[A]ESS. [F#m]
It's [Bm]hard to over[E7]state
my satis[A]faction. [F#m A]
{newline}
[F#m]Aperture [A]Science [F#m A]
We [F#m]do what we [A]must
be[F#m]cause we [A]can. [F#m]
[Bm]For the good of [E7]all of us.
Except the [Fmaj7]ones who are dead.

{start_of_chorus}
  But there's [C]no sense [G]crying
  over [F]every mis[C]take.
  You just [C]keep on [G]trying
  till you [F]run out of [C]cake.
  And the [Dm]science gets [G]done.
  And you [C]make a [C/B*]neat [Am]gum.
  For the [F]people who [E]are
  still a[A]live. [F#m A]
{end_of_chorus}

I'm [F#m]not even [A]angry. [F#m A]
[F#m]I'm being [A]so sin[F#m]cere right [A]now. [F#m]
[Bm]Even though you [E7]broke my heart.
And [A]killed me [F#m A]
{newline}
And [F#m]tore me to [A]pieces. [F#m A]
And [F#m]threw every [A]piece in[F#m]to a [A]fire. [F#m]
[Bm]As they burned it [E7]hurt because
I was so [Fmaj7]happy for you!

{start_of_chorus}
  Now these [C]points of [G]data
  make a [F]beautiful [C]line
  And we're [C]out of [G]beta.
  We're re[F]leasing on [C]time.
  So I'm [Dm]GLaD. I got [G]burned.
  Think of [C]all the [C/B*]things we [Am]learned
  for the [F]people who [E]are
  still a[A]live. [F#m A]
{end_of_chorus}

[F#m]Go ahead and [A]leave me. [F#m A]
I [F#m]think I'd pre[A]fer to [F#m]stay in[A]side. [F#m]
[Bm]Maybe you'll find [E7]someone else
to [A]help you. [F#m A]
{newline}
[F#m]Maybe Black [A]Mesa. [F#m A]
[F#m]THAT WAS A [A]JOKE. Ha [F#m]ha, FAT [A]CHANCE. [F#m]
[Bm]Anyway this [E7]cake is great.
It's so de[Fmaj7]licious and moist.

{start_of_chorus}
  Look at [C]me still [G]talking
  when there's [F]Science to [C]do.
  When I [C]look out [G]there,
  it makes me [F]GLaD I'm not [C]you.
  I've ex[Dm]periments to [G]run.
  There is [C]research [C/B*]to be [Am]done.
  On the [F]people who [E]are
  still a[A]live. [F#m]
{end_of_chorus}

And be[A]lieve me I [F#m]am
still a[A]live. [F#m]
I'm doing [A]science and [F#m]I'm
still a[A]live [F#m]
I feel fan[A]tastic and [F#m]I'm
still a[A]live [F#m]
And while you're [A]dying I'll [F#m]be
still a[A]live [F#m]
And when you're [A]dead I will [F#m]be
still a[A]live [F#m]
STILL A[A]LIVE [F#m]
Still a[A]live.
