    This was a [A]triumph. [F#m A]
    I'm [F#m]making a [A]note here:
    [F#m]HUGE SUCC[A]ESS. [F#m]
    It's [Bm]hard to over[E7]state
    my satis[A]faction. [F#m A]
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [F#m]Aperture [A]Science [F#m A]
    We [F#m]{do what} we [A]must
    be[F#m]cause we [A]can. [F#m]
    [Bm]{For the} good of [E7]{all of} us.
    Except the [Fmaj7]{ones who} are dead.
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    But there's [C]{no sense} [G]crying
    over [F]every mis[C]take.
    You just [C]keep on [G]trying
    till you [F]run out of [C]cake.
    And the [Dm]science gets [G]done.
    And you [C]make a [C/B*]neat [Am]gum.
    For the [F]people who [E]are
    still a[A]live. [F#m A]
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      I'm [F#m]{not even} [A]angry. [F#m A]
      [F#m]{I'm being} [A]{so sin}[F#m]{cere right} [A]now. [F#m]
      [Bm]Even though you [E7]broke my heart.
      And [A]killed me [F#m A]
    

    \begin{verse*}
      And [F#m]{tore me} to [A]pieces. [F#m A]
      And [F#m]{threw every} [A]piece in[F#m]{to a} [A]fire. [F#m]
      [Bm]{As they} burned it [E7]hurt because
      I was so [Fmaj7]{happy for} you!
    \end{verse*}

    {start_of_chorus}
      Now these [C]points of [G]data
      make a [F]beautiful [C]line
      And we're [C]out of [G]beta.
      We're re[F]leasing on [C]time.
      So I'm [Dm]GLaD. I got [G]burned.
      Think of [C]{all the} [C/B*]things we [Am]learned
      for the [F]people who [E]are
      still a[A]live. [F#m A]
    {end_of_chorus}

    
      [F#m]{Go ahead} and [A]leave me. [F#m A]
      I [F#m]think I'd pre[A]{fer to} [F#m]stay in[A]side. [F#m]
      [Bm]{Maybe you'll} find [E7]someone else
      to [A]help you. [F#m A]
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [F#m]Maybe Black [A]Mesa. [F#m A]
      [F#m]THAT WAS A [A]JOKE. Ha [F#m]{ha, FAT} [A]CHANCE. [F#m]
      [Bm]Anyway this [E7]cake is great.
      It's so de[Fmaj7]{licious and} moist.
    \end{verse*}

    {start_of_chorus}
      Look at [C]{me still} [G]talking
      when there's [F]Science to [C]do.
      When I [C]look out [G]there,
      it makes me [F]GLaD I'm not [C]you.
      I've ex[Dm]periments to [G]run.
      There is [C]research [C/B*]{to be} [Am]done.
      On the [F]people who [E]are
      still a[A]live. [F#m]
    {end_of_chorus}
  \end{repeatedchords}

  
    And be[A]lieve me I [F#m]am
    still a[A]live. [F#m]
    I'm doing [A]science and [F#m]I'm
    still a[A]live [F#m]
    I feel fan[A]tastic and [F#m]I'm
    still a[A]live [F#m]
    And while you're [A]dying I'll [F#m]be
    still a[A]live [F#m]
    And when you're [A]dead I will [F#m]be
    still a[A]live [F#m]
    STILL A[A]LIVE [F#m]
    Still a[A]live.
