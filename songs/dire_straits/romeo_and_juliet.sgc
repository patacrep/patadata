      Come up on different streets, they both the streets of shame
    Both dirty both mean, yes and even and dream was just the same
    And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
    How can you look at me as if I was just another part of your deal
    

    \begin{verse*}
      Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
    you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
    You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
    Now you just say oh Romeo yeah, I used to have a scene with him
    \end{verse*}

    {end_of_chorus}

  
      I can't do the talk, like they talk on the TV
    I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
    I can't do anything, but I'd do anything for you
    I cant't do anything but be in love with you
    

    \begin{verse*}
      And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
    All I do is keep the beat and bad company
    All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
    Juliet I'd do the stars with you anytime
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
