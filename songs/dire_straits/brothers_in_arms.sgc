    These [F#]mist-covered [E]mountain[F#]s
    Are a home now for [B]me [B4] [B]
    But my [D#m]home is the [G#m]lowlan[D#m]ds
    And always will [E]be [F#4]
    Some [F#]day you'll retu[G#m]rn to [D#m]
    Your valleys and your far[E]ms [C#m] [F#4]
    And you'll [F#]no longer [G#m]burn
    To be [E]brothers in [F#4]arms [F#]

      Through these [F#]fields of des[E]truction [F#]
      Baptisms of fir[B]e [B4] [B]
      I've [D#m]witnessed your s[G#m]ufferin[D#m]g
      As the battles raged high[E]er [F#4]
      And [F#]though they hurt [G#m]me so [D#m]bad
      In the fear and a[E]larm [C#m] [F#4]
      You [F#]did not de[G#m]sert me

    [G#m] There's so [F#]many different [G#m]worlds
    [F#] So [B]many different [E]suns [F#4]

      Now the [F#]sun's gone to [E]hell [F#]

      Let me [D#m]bid you farewe[G#m]ll [D#m]
