    [C]I've [Em]got too many [F]questions in my [G]mind
    [C]I've [Em]got too many [F]answers to [G]find
    [C]Can [Em]I give up [F]all I've [G]imagined
    [C]Am [Em]I [F]imagical enough for this [G]to happen
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Because [C]I like you, \echo{I like you}
    [Em]I like you, \echo{I like [F]you} [G]
    And [C]like can lead to [G]like like
    And [C]like like can lead to [E7]love
    As sure [C]as the stars above
    [Em]I'd really like to [F]kiss you, \echo{fuck you}, oh [G]
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Can I be the man you're looking for
    Can I really throw you out of my door
    I'll try real hard not to lose her
    I'll try to be less of a loser
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Because I like you, \echo{I like you}
    I like you, \echo{I like you}
    And like can lead to like like
    And like like can lead to love
    As sure as the stars above
    [Em]I'd really like to [F]kiss you
    Kiss you, [G]kiss you, kiss you, [C]fuck you
  {end_of_chorus}
