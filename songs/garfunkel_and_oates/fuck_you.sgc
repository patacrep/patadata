[C]I've [Em]got too many [F]questions in my [G]mind
[C]I've [Em]got too many [F]answers to [G]find
[C]Can [Em]I give up [F]all I've [G]imagined
[C]Am [Em]I [F]imagical enough for this [G]to happen

{start_of_chorus}
  Because [C]I like you, {echo: I like you}
  [Em]I like you, {echo: I like [F]you} [G]
  And [C]like can lead to [G]like like
  And [C]like like can lead to [E7]love
  As sure [C]as the stars above
  [Em]I'd really like to [F]kiss you, {echo: fuck you}, oh [G]
{end_of_chorus}

Can I be the man you're looking for
Can I really throw you out of my door
I'll try real hard not to lose her
I'll try to be less of a loser

{start_of_chorus}
  Because I like you, {echo: I like you}
  I like you, {echo: I like you}
  And like can lead to like like
  And like like can lead to love
  As sure as the stars above
  [Em]I'd really like to [F]kiss you
  Kiss you, [G]kiss you, kiss you, [C]fuck you
{end_of_chorus}
