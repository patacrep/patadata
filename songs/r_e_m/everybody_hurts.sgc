[D]When your day is l[G]ong and the n[D]ight
The night is you[G]rs al[D]one
When you're sure you've ha[G]d enough of this lif[D*]e
Well hang [G]on

{start_of_chorus}
  [Em]Don't let yourself go[A] [Em]
  Cause everybody cr[A]ies [Em]
  And [A]everybody hurts
{end_of_chorus}

Sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone
{echo: Hold on, hold on}
If you feel like letting go
{echo: Hold on}
If you think you've had too much of this life
Well hang on

{start_of_chorus}
  Cause everybody hurts
  Take comfort in your friends
  Everybody hurts
{end_of_chorus}

[F#] Don't throw your han[Bm]d [F#]
Whoa [Bm]now[F#] don't throw your h[Bm]and [C]
If you feel like you're a[G]lone n[C]o no no you're no[C/B]t alon[Am]e

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life
To hang on

{start_of_chorus}
  Well everybody hurts sometimes
  Everybody cries
  And everybody hurts
{end_of_chorus}

Sometimes
But everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on hold on
Everybody hurts
You are not alone
