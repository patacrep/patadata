    [D]When your day is l[G]ong and the n[D]ight
    The night is you[G]{rs al}[D]one
    When you're sure you've ha[G]{d enough} of this lif[D*]e
    Well hang [G]on
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Em]Don't let yourself go[A] [Em]
    Cause everybody cr[A]ies [Em]
    And [A]everybody hurts
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Sometimes
    Sometimes everything is wrong
    Now it's time to sing along
    When your day is night alone
    \echo{Hold on, hold on}
    If you feel like letting go
    \echo{Hold on}
    If you think you've had too much of this life
    Well hang on
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Cause everybody hurts
    Take comfort in your friends
    Everybody hurts
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    [F#]{ Don't} throw your han[Bm]d [F#]
    Whoa [Bm]now[F#]{ don't} throw your h[Bm]and [C]
    If you feel like you're a[G]lone n[C]{o no no} you're no[C/B]{t alon}[Am]e
  

  
    If you're on your own in this life
    The days and nights are long
    When you think you've had too much of this life
    To hang on
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Well everybody hurts sometimes
    Everybody cries
    And everybody hurts
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Sometimes
    But everybody hurts sometimes
    So hold on hold on hold on hold on
    Hold on hold on hold on hold on
    Everybody hurts
    You are not alone
