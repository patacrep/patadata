    So speak kind to a stranger
    Cause you'll never know
    It just might be an angel come
    Knockin' at your door \rep{2}
  

  
    Waiting on an angel
    One to carry me home
    Hope you come to see me soon
    Cause I don't wanna go alone
    I don't wanna go alone
    Don't wanna go
    I don't wanna go alone
