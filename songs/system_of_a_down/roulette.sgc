[Cm]I have a [D#]problem that [Bb]I cannot e[C#]xplain
[C#]I have no [G#]reason why it [A#]should have been so [Cm]plain
[Cm]Have no qu[D#]estions but [Bb]I sure have e[C#]xcuse
[C#]I lack the r[G#]eason why I s[A#]hould be so c[Cm]onfused

{start_of_chorus}
  [Cm]I [G]know, [A#]how I [A#]feel when [G#]I'm a[A#]round [Cm]you
  [Cm]I, don't [G]know, [A#]how I [A#]feel when [G#]I'm [G#]around [Cm]you
  Around you

Left a message but it ain't a bit of use
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained
Playing the show and running down the plane
