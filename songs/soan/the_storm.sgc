    I [C]thought she was a hurricane
    She said I am a storm
    Whispering [Am]old fairytales
    I'm turning on my own
    Would you c[C]ome and blow with me
    Forever and a day
    I'm so [Am]glad to cross your way
    Said I but I'm a tree

    [F]Sorry please kill me I ne[G]ed you

      And [C]anyway tomorrow comes
      The season of the witch
      I'll be pr[Am]aying thunderstorms
      If you don't call the beast
      I'm the [C]one to disappear
      She said I love you so
      But l[Am]ove isn't everything
      So ``Shut!'' said I and blow
    \end{repeatedchords}
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [F]Sorry please kill me I ne[G]ed you
    If you [F]missed me I could m[G]iss you
    [F]I've been sober for a [G]week
    [F] I don't need to grow [G]older [C]
    [F] Sober and [C]over \rep{3}
