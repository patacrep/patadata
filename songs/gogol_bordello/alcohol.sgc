[Am]Yeah, oh [G]yeah, you [F]seen me [E]walk
On burning [Am]bridges
Yeah, oh yeah, you seen me fall
In love with witches
And you know my head is held
Inside by stitches
Yet, you know I did survive
All of your lovely sieges

{start_of_chorus}
  [Am]And you know that I'll pick [F]up
  Every time you [C]call
  Just to thank you one more [E]time
  Alco[Am]hol
  [Am G F E] Alco[Am]hol {repeat: 2}

{start_of_chorus}
  And you know that I'll survive
  Every time you come
  Just to thank you one more time
  For everything you've done
{end_of_chorus}

I am sorry some of us
Given you bad name
Yeah, oh yeah, cause without you
Nothing is the same
Yeah, oh yeah, I miss you so
Every time we break up
Just to hit a higher note
Every time we make up

Who is crawlin' up my spine
{echo: Alcohol}
I was waiting long long time
{echo: Alcohol}
Now you teach me how to rhyme
{echo: Alcohol}
Just don't stab me in the back
With a cortisol
{newline}
Now forever reunite
{echo: Alcohol}
Now you teach me how to rhyme
{echo: Alcohol}
Screw a light bulb in my head
{echo: Alcohol}
May that ceremony be
Happy or sad
