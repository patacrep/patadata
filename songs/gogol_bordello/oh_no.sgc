{guitar_comment: Intro: [Em]}
{newline}
Sometimes when facing common [B]trouble
When whole town is [Em]screwed
We become actually [B]human
Act like Prometheus [Em]would
{newline}
Suddenly there is more [A]humor
And a party tabor [G]style
People ringing one an[B]other
``Yo man, how was your black[Em]out?''

Suddenly there is more music
Made with buckets in a park
Girls are dancing with the flashlights
I got only one guitar
{newline}
And you see brothers and sisters
All engaged in sport of help
Making merry out of nothing
Like in refugee camp

{start_of_chorus}
  Oh yeah, oh [D]no, it [B]doesn't have to be [Em]so
  It is possible any [B]time anywhere
  Even without any [Em]dough
  Oh yeah, oh [D]no, it [B]doesn't have to be [Em]so
  The forces of [B]creative mind are unstopapapapa[Em]bable!
{end_of_chorus}

And you think, alright now people
They have finally woke up
But as soon as trouble over
Watch them take another nap
{newline}
Now nobody's making merry
Only trotting scared of boss
Everybody's making hurry
For some old forgotten cause

But one thing surely eternal
It's condition of a man
Who don't know where he is going
Who don't know where does he stand
{newline}
Who's dream power is a bottle
Put away in dry dark place
Who's youth power is well buried
Under propaganda waves
{newline}
Who's dream life in opposition
To the life during the day
Who's beaten down in believing
It just kinda goes this way!
