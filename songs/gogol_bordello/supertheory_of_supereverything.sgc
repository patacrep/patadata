    [Am]First time I had [E]read the Bible
    [E]It had struck me [Am]as unwitting
    [Am]I think it may [E]start a rumor
    [E]That the Lord ain't [Am]got no humor
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [Am]Put [E]me inside SS[Am]C
    [Am]Let's [E]test superstring [Am]theory
    [Am]Oh yo yo [Dm]yo, accelerate the [Am]protons
    [Am]{Ah stir} it [E]twice and then just add [Am]me, [E]{'cause}
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Am]{I don't} read the [E]Bible \echo{Bible}
    [E]{I don't} trust [Am]disciple \echo{disciple}
    [Am]Even if they're [E]made of marble
    [E]Or Canal Street [Am]bling

    From the maelstrom of the knowledge
    Into labyrinth of doubt
    Frozen underground ocean
    Melting, nuking on my mind
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Give me Everything Theory
    Without Nazi uniformity
    My brothers are protons \echo{protons}
    My sisters are neurons \echo{neurons}
    Ah stir it twice, it's instant family
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    My brothers are protons \echo{protons}
    My sisters are neutrons \echo{neutrons}
    Ah stir it twice
    \emph{Dlja prekrastnih dam}
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{verse*}
    Do you have sex maniacs
    Or schizophrenics
    Or astrophysicists in your family
    Was my grandma anti anti
    Was my grandpa bounty bounty
    He he he he
    They ask in embassy
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    And my grandma, she was anti
    And my grandpa, he was bounty
    Ah stir it twice
    And then just add me
  {end_of_chorus}
