    [C]Yesterday
    [E7]All my troubles seemed so [Am]far away
    [F]Now it [G7]seems as though they're [C]here to stay
    Oh, [Am]I be[F]lieve in [C]yesterday
  

  
    Suddenly
    I'm not half the man I used to be
    There's a shadow hanging over me
    Oh, yesterday came suddenly
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [E7]Why she [Am]had [E7]to g[Am]o
    I don't [G7]know, she wouldn't [C]say
    [E7]I said [Am]some[E7]thing [Am]wrong
    Now I [G7]long for yester[C]day
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Yesterday
    Love was such an easy game to play
    Now I need a place to hide away
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
  

  
    Yesterday
    Love was such an easy game to play
    Now I need a place to hide away
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
