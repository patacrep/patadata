In the [D]town [C]where I [G]was born
[Em]Lived a [Am]man who [C]sailed to [D]sea
[G]And he [D]told us [C]of his [G]life
[Em]In the [Am]land of [C]subma[D]rines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

{start_of_chorus}
  [G]We all live in our [D]yellow submarine
  Yellow submarine, [G]yellow submarine
  [G]We all live in our [D]yellow submarine
  Yellow submarine, [G]yellow submarine
{end_of_chorus}

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
