When I [C]find myself in [G]times of trouble
[Am]Mother Mary [F]comes to me
[C]Speaking words of [G]wisdom
Let it [F*]be [E* D* C*]
{newline}
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

{start_of_chorus}
  Let it [Am]be, let it [G]be
  Let it [F]be, let it [C]be
  [C]Whisper words of [G]wisdom
  Let it [F*]be [E* D* C*]
{end_of_chorus}

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
{newline}
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light, that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow
Let it be
{newline}
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
