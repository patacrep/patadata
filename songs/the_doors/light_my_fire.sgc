You [Am7]know that it would be [F#m7]untrue
You [Am7]know that it would be a [F#m7]liar
[Am7]If I was to say to [F#m7]you
[Am7]Girl we couldn't get much [F#m7]higher

{start_of_chorus}
  [G]Come on baby [A]light my [D]fire
  [G]Come on baby [A]light my [D]fire
  [G]Try to set the [D]night on [E]fire
{end_of_chorus}

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only loose
And our love become a funeral pyre
