Well, I [G]thought I heard the captain say
``Pay me my [D]money down
Tomorrow is my sailing day
Pay me my [G]money down''

{start_of_chorus}
  [G] Pay me, pay me
  Pay me my [D]money down
  Pay me or go to jail
  Pay me my [G]money down
{end_of_chorus}

[G]Soon as that boat was clear of the bar
Pay me my [D]money down
He knocked me down with the end of a spar
Pay me my [G]money down

Well [G]if I'd been a rich man's son
Pay me my [D]money down
I'd sit on the river and watch it run
Pay me my [G]money down

{transposition: 3}

Well, I wish [G]I was Mr. Gates
Pay me my [D]money down
Haul my money in egg crates
Pay me my [G]money down

{transposition: -3}

Well, [G]40 nights, nights at sea
Pay me my [D]money down
Captain worked every last dollar out of me
Pay me my [G]money down
