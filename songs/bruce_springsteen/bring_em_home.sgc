If you [C]love this land of the free
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
Bring them [F]back from over[C]seas
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home

It will [C]make the politicians sad, I know
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
They wanna [F]tangle with their [C]foe
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home

They wanna [C]test their grand theories
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
With the [F]blood of you and [C]me
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home

Now we'll [C]give no more brave young lives
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
For the [F]gleam in someone's [C]eyes
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home

The men will [C]cheer and the boys will shout
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
Yeah and we [F]will all turn [C]out
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home

The church [C]bells will ring with joy
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
To welcome our [F]darlin', girls and [C]boys
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home

We will [C]lift their voice and song
Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
When John[F]ny comes marching [C]home
Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
