    If you [C]love this land of the free
    Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
    Bring them [F]back from over[C]seas
    Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
  

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      It will [C]make the politicians sad, I know
      Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
      They wanna [F]tangle with their [C]foe
      Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
    

    
      They wanna [C]test their grand theories
      Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
      With the [F]blood of you and [C]me
      Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
    

    
      Now we'll [C]give no more brave young lives
      Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
      For the [F]gleam in someone's [C]eyes
      Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
    

    
      The men will [C]cheer and the boys will shout
      Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
      Yeah and we [F]will all turn [C]out
      Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
    

    
      The church [C]bells will ring with joy
      Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
      To welcome our [F]darlin', girls and [C]boys
      Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
    

    
      We will [C]lift their voice and song
      Bring 'em [Am]home, bring 'em home
      When John[F]ny comes marching [C]home
      Bring 'em [G]home, bring 'em [C]home
    
  \end{repeatedchords}
