    [D]Well I don't know why I came here tonight
    [D]{I got} the feeling that something ain't right
    I'm so [G7]scared in case I fall off my chair
    And I'm [D]wondering how I'll get down the stairs
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [A]Clowns to the left of me
    [C]Jokers to the [G]right, here I am
    [D]Stuck in the middle with you
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    [D]Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you
    [D]And I'm wondering what it is I should do
    It's so [G7]hard to keep this smile from my face
    Losing con[D]trol, yeah, I'm all over the place
  

  
    Well you [G7]started out with nothing
    And you're proud that you're a self made man [D]
    And your [G7]friends, they all come crawlin, slap you on the back and say
    [D]Please, [A7]please
  

  
    [D]Trying to make some sense of it all
    [D]But I can see that it makes no sense at all
    Is it [G7]cool to go to sleep on the floor
    'Cause I don't [D]think that I can take anymore
  

  
    [D]Well I don't know why I came here tonight
    I got the [D]feeling that something ain't right
    I'm so [G7]scared in case I fall off my chair
    And I'm [D]wondering how I'll get down the stairs
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Yes I'm[D]{ stuck} in the middle with you
    Here I am,[D]{ stuck} in the middle with you
  \end{verse*}
