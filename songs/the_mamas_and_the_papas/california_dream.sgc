    All the leaves are [Am]brown[G] [F]
    And the [G]sky is [E7]gray
    [F]I've been for a [C]walk[G] [Am]
    On a [F]winter's [E7]day
  

  
    I'd be safe and [Am]warm[G] [F]
    If I [G]was in L.[E7]A.~
    California [Am]dreaming[G] [F]
    On [G]such a winter's [E7]day
  

  
    Stopped into a church
    I passed along the way
    Oh I got down on my knees
    And I pretend to pray
  

  
    You know the preacher likes the cold
    He knows I'm gonna stay
    California dreaming
    On such a winter's day
  

  
    All the leaves are brown
    And the sky is gray
    I've been for a walk
    On a winter's day
  

  
    If I didn't tell her
    I could leave today
    California [Am]dreaming[G] [F]
    On [G]such a winter's [E7]day[F]
    On [G]such a winter's [Am]day[G] [F]
    On [G]such a winter's [F]day[Am]
