  \begin{verse*}
    \musicnote{\Intro: \nolyrics [D]}
  \end{verse*}

  
    If [D]you, if you could return
    Don't let it [A]burn, don't let it fade
    I'm sure I'm not being [C]rude
    But it's just your attitude
    It's tearing me [G]apart
    It's ruining everything
  

  \begin{verse*}
    And I [D]swore, I swore I would be true
    And honey so did [A]you
    So why were you holding her [C]hand?
    Is that the way we stand?
    Were you lying all the [G]time?
    Was it just a game to you?
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    But I'm in so [D]deep
    You know I'm such a [A]fool for you
    You got me wrapped around your [C]finger
    Do you have to let it [G]linger?
    Do you have to? Do you have to?
    Do you have to let it [D]linger?
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Oh, I [A]thought the world of you
    I thought [C]nothing could go wrong
    But I was [G]wrong
    I was wrong
    If [D]you, if you could get by
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Trying not to [A]lie
    Things wouldn't be so [C]confused
    And I wouldn't feel so used
    But you always really [G]knew
    I just wanna be with you
  \end{verse*}
