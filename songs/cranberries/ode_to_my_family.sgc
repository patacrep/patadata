    [C]Unders[Am]tand the things I [Em]say, don't [F]turn away from [C]me
    [C]'Cause I've spent [Am]half my life out [Em]there, you [F]wouldn't disa[C]gree
    [C]Do you see me[Am]? Do you see? Do you [Em]like me? Do you [F]like me, standing [C]there?
    [C]Do you notice[Am]? Do you know? Do you [Em]see me? Do you [F]see me? Does anyone [C]care?

    [C]Unhappi[Am]ness, where's when [Em]I was young and we [F]didn't give a [C]damn
    [C]'Cause we were [Am]raised, to see [Em]life as fun and [F]take it if we [C]can
    [C]My mother[Am], my mother, she [Em]hold me, she [F]hold me, when I was out [C]there
    [C]My father[Am], my father, he [Em]liked me, oh he [F]liked me, does anyone [C]care?

    Understand what I've become, it wasn't my design
    And people everywhere think, something better than I am
    But I miss you, I miss, 'cause I liked it, 'cause I liked it, when I was out there
    Do you know this? Do you know? You did not find me, you did not find, does anyone care?

    Unhappiness, where's when I was young and we didn't give a damn
    'Cause we were raised, to see life as fun and take it if we can
    My mother, my mother, she hold me, she hold me, when I was out there
    My father, my father, he liked me, oh he liked me
