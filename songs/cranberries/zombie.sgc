[Em]Another [C]head hangs lowly
[G]Child is slowly [D]taken
[Em]And the violence [C]caused such silence
[G]Who are we mis[D]taken
{newline}
But you [Em]see, it's not me
It's not [C]my family
In your [G]head, in your head
They are figh[D]ting

{start_of_chorus}
  With their [Em]tanks and their bombs
  And their [C]bombs and their guns
  In your [G]head, in your head
  They are [D]crying
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  In your [Em]head, in your [C]head
  Zombie, [G]zombie, zombi[D]e
  What's in your [Em]head, in your [C]head
  Zombie, [G]zombie, zombi[D]e
{end_of_chorus}

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
{newline}
It's the same old theme
Since 1916
In your head, in your head
They're still fighting

{start_of_chorus}
  With their tanks and their bombs
  And their bombs and their guns
  In your head, in your head
  They're dying
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  In your head, in your head
  Zombie, zombie, zombie
  What's in your head, in your head
  Zombie, zombie, zombie
{end_of_chorus}
