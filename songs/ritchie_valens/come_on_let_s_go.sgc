Let's go, let's go, let's go, little sweet heart
Now that we can always be together
Come on, come on, let's go again

Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, little darlin'
Tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go and again and again and again
Come on, let's go, and do it again and again and again and again
And again and again and again
