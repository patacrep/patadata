    [C] Call you up in the middle of the night
    [Em] Like a firefly without a light
    [Am] You were there like a slow torch burning
    [G] I was a key that could use a little turning
  

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    \begin{verse*}
      [C] So tired that I couldn't even sleep
      [Em] So many secrets I couldn't keep
      [Am] Promised myself I wouldn't weep
      [G] One more promise I couldn't keep
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}

  \begin{verse*}
    It [F]seems no one can [G]help me now
    I'm [C]in too deep
    There's [Am]no way out
    [F]This time I have [Em]really led my[G]self astray
  \end{verse*}


  {start_of_chorus}
    [C] Runaway train never going back
    [Em] Wrong way on a one way track
    [Am] Seems like I should be getting somewhere
    [G] Somehow I'm neither here nor there
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [C] Can you help me remember how to smile
      [Em] Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
      [Am] How on earth did I get so jaded
      [G] Life's mystery seems so faded
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [C] I can go where no one else can go
      [Em] I know what no one else knows
      [Am] Here I am just drownin' in the rain
      [G] With a ticket for a runaway train
    \end{verse*}

    \begin{verse*}
      [F]Everything is [G]cut and dry
      [C]Day and night
      [Am]Eearth and sky
      [F]Somehow I [Em]just don't be[G]lieve it
    \end{verse*}

    
      [C] Bought a ticket for a runaway train
      [Em] Like a madman laughin' at the rain
      [Am] Little out of touch, little insane
      [G] Just easier than dealing with the pain
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [C] Runaway train never comin' back
      [Em] Runaway train tearin' up the track
      [Am] Runaway train burnin' in my veins
      [G] Runaway but it always seems the same
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
