{start_of_chorus}
  D[G]on't you [Cadd9]know
  [Em]They're talkin' about [Dsus4]a revolu[G]tion
  It [Cadd9]sounds [Em]like [D]a whisper
  Don't you know
  They're talkin' about a revolution
  It sounds like a whisper
{end_of_chorus}

While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

{start_of_chorus}
  D[G]on't you [Cadd9]know
  [Em]They're talkin' about [Dsus4]a revolu[G]tion
  It [Cadd9]sounds [Em]like [D]a whisper
  Don't you know
  They're talkin' about a revolution
  It sounds like a whisper
{end_of_chorus}

Poor people gonna rise up
And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up
And take what's theirs

{start_of_chorus}
  Don't you know
  You better run, run, run...
  Oh I said you better
  Run, run, run...
  Finally the tables are starting to turn
  Talkin' about a revolution
{end_of_chorus}
