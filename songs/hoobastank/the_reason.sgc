    [D]I'm not a perfect per[Bm]son
    There's many things I wish I didn't [D]do
    But I continue lear[Bm]ning
    I never meant to do those things to [G]you
    And so I have to say before I [A]go
    That I just want you to k[D]now
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    I've found a reason for [Bm]me
    To change who I used to [G]be
    A reason to start over [A]new
    And the reason is [D]you
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    I'm sorry that I hurt you
    It's something I must live with everyday
    And all the pain I put you through
    I wish that I could take it all away
    And be the one who catches all your tears
    That's why I need you to hear
  

  
    I'm not a perfect person
    There's many things I wish I didn't do
    But I continue learning
    I never meant to do those things to you
    And so I have to say before I go
    That I just want you to know
