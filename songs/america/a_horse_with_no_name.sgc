    On the [Em]first part of the [D6/9]journey
    I was [Em]lookin at all the [D6/9]life
    There were [Em]plants and birds and [D6/9]rocks and things
    There were [Em]sand and hills and [D6/9]rings

    The [Em]first thing I met was a [D6/9]fly with a buzz
    And the [Em]sky with no [D6/9]clouds
    The [Em]heat was hot and the [D6/9]ground was dry
    But the [Em]air was full of [D6/9]sound
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    I've [Em9]been thru the desert on a [Dmaj9]horse with no name
    It felt [Em9]good to be out of the [Dmaj9]rain
    In the [Em]desert you can't [Dmaj9]remember your name
    Cause there [Em]ain't no one for to [Dmaj9]give you no pain
    [Em9]La la la
    [Dmaj9]La la la la la
    [Em9]La la la
    [Dmaj9]La la la la la

    \begin{bridge}
      After [Em]two days in the [D6/9]desert sun
      My [Em]skin began to turn [D6/9]red
      After [Em]three days in the [D6/9]desert fun
      I was [Em]looking at a river [D6/9]bed
    \end{bridge}

    \begin{bridge}
      And the [Em]story it told of a [D6/9]river that flowed
      Made me [Em]sad to think it was [D6/9]dead
    \end{bridge}
    
      After [Em]nine days I let the [D6/9]horse run free
      Cause the [Em]desert had [D6/9]turned to sea
      There were [Em]plants and birds and [D6/9]rocks and things
      There were [Em]sand and hills and [D6/9]rings

      The [Em]ocean is a desert with its [D6/9]life underground
      And the [Em]perfect disguise [D6/9]above
      Under the [Em]cities lies a [D6/9]heart made of ground
      But the [Em]humans will give no [D6/9]love
    
  \end{repeatedchords}
