    \[Em]Road trippin' with my two \[C]favorite al\[B]lies
    Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
    It's time to leave this town, it's time to steal away
    Let's go get lost anywhere in the USA
    Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

    \[C] Just a \[B]mirror for the \[Am]sun \[Bm C G]
    \[Am] These smiling \[Bm]eyes are just a \[C]mirror for \[G]
  \end{chorus}

    Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
