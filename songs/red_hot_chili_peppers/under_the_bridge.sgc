[E] Sometimes [B]I feel like I [C#m]don't have a [G#m]part[A]ner
[E] Sometimes [B]I feel like [C#m]my only [A]friend
Is the [E]city I [B]live in, the city of angels, the [C#m]city of [G#m]an[A]gels
[E]Lonely as [B]I am [C#m]together we [A]cry [Emaj7]

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses the winded
I never worried, now that is a lie

{start_of_chorus}
  [F#m]I don't ever want to [E]feel
  [B] Like I [F#m]did that day
  [F#m]Take me to the place I [E]love
  [B] Take me [F#m]all the way
  {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

[A]Oh [Am7]no no no, [G6]yeah, [Fmaj7]yeah {repeat: 3}

[A]Under the bridge [C]down-town
[G6]is where I[Fmaj7] drew some blood
{newline}
Under the bridge down-town
I could not get enough
{newline}
Under the bridge down-town
Forgot about my love
{newline}
Under the bridge down-town
I gave my life away
{newline}
Oh no no no, yeah, yeah {repeat: 4}
