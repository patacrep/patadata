    [E] Sometimes [B]I feel like I [C#m]don't have a [G#m]part[A]ner
    [E] Sometimes [B]I feel like [C#m]my only [A]friend
    Is the [E]city I [B]live in, the city of angels, the [C#m]city of [G#m]an[A]gels
    [E]Lonely as [B]I am [C#m]together we [A]cry [EM7]
  

  
    I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
    I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
    She sees my good deeds and she kisses the winded
    I never worried, now that is a lie
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [F#m]{I don't} ever want to [E]feel
    [B] Like I [F#m]did that day
    [F#m]Take me to the place I [E]love
    [B] Take me [F#m]all the way

    It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
    It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
    At least I have her love, the city she loves me
    Lonely as I am together we cry
  

  
    [A]Oh [Am7]no no no, [G6]yeah, [FM7]yeah \rep{3}
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [A]Under the bridge [C]down-town
    [G6]is where I[FM7] drew some blood
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Under the bridge down-town
    I could not get enough
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Under the bridge down-town
    Forgot about my love
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Under the bridge down-town
    I gave my life away
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Oh no no no, yeah, yeah \rep{4}
  \end{verse*}
