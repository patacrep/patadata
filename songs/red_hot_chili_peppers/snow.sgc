#first verse pattern

[G#m]Come to decide that the [E]things that I tried
Were [B]in my life just [F#]to get high on
When I sit alone come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
{newline}
Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
And I do believe it, we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

#chorus

{start_of_chorus}
  Hey oh
  Listen what I say oh
  {echo: I got your} Hey oh
  Now listen what I say oh
{end_of_chorus}

#first verse pattern

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside
{newline}
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside

#chorus extended

{start_of_chorus}
  Hey oh
  Listen what I say oh
  {echo: Come back and} Hey oh
  Look at what I say oh
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  [E]The more I see, the less I know
  The more I like to let it go
  [G#m]Hey oh
  Wo-oo wo-oo [E]wo
{end_of_chorus}

#second chorus

[B]Deep beneath the cover of another [F#]perfect wonder
Where it's [C#m]so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through a field where all my tracks will
Be concealed and there is nowhere to go

#first verse pattern

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
{newline}
Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
