  %first verse pattern
  \begin{verse}
    \[G#m]Come to decide that the \[E]things that I tried
    Were \[B]in my life just \[F#]to get high on
    When I sit alone come get a little known
    But I need more than myself this time
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
    And I do believe it, we rely on
    When I lay it on, come get to play it on
    All my life to sacrifice
  \end{verse*}

    Hey oh
    Listen what I say oh

    Now listen what I say oh
  \end{chorus}

  %first verse pattern
  \begin{verse}
    When will I know that I really can't go
    To the well once more time to decide on
    When it's killing me, when will I really see
    All that I need to look inside
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    Come to believe that I better not leave
    Before I get my chance to ride
    When it's killing me, what do I really need
    All that I need to look inside
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{chorus}
    Hey oh
    Listen what I say oh
    \echo{Come back and} Hey oh
    Look at what I say oh
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[E]The more I see, the less I know
    The more I like to let it go
    \[G#m]Hey oh
    Wo-oo wo-oo \[E]wo
  \end{chorus}

  %second chorus
  \begin{verse*}
    \[B]Deep beneath the cover of another \[F#]perfect wonder
    Where it's \[C#m]so white as snow
    Privately divided by a world so undecided
    And there's nowhere to go
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    In between the cover of another perfect wonder
    And it's so white as snow
    Running through a field where all my tracks will
    Be concealed and there is nowhere to go
  \end{verse*}

  %first verse pattern
  \begin{verse}
    When to descend to amend for a friend
    All the channels that have broken down
    Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
    Just to hear you sing it out
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
    And I do believe what we rely on
    When I lay it on, come get to play it on
    All my life to sacrifice
  \end{verse*}
