[G]Love is a [C]burning [G]thing
And it makes a [C]firery [G]ring
Bound by [C]wild [G]desire
I fell into a [C]ring of [G]fire

{start_of_chorus}
  [D]I fell into a [C]burning ring of [G]fire
  I went [D]down, down, down
  And the [C]flames went [G]higher
  And it [G]burns, burns, burns
  The [C]ring of [G]fire {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
