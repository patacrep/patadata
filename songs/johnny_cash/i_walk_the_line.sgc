    [F]{I keep} a [C7]close watch on this heart of [F]mine
    [F]{I keep} my [C7]eyes wide open all the [F]time
    [F]{I keep} the [B&]ends out for the tie that [F]binds
    [F]Because you're [C7]mine, I walk the [F]line
  

  
    I find it very, very easy to be true
    I find myself alone when each day is through
    Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
    Because you're mine, I walk the line
  

  
    As sure as night is dark and day is light
    I keep you on my mind both day and night
    And happiness I've known proves that it's right
    Because you're mine, I walk the line
  

  
    You've got a way to keep me on your side
    You give me cause for love that I can't hide
    For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
    Because you're mine, I walk the line
