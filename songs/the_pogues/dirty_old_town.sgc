[Am] I met my [C]love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a [F]dream by the old ca[C]nal
Kissed a girl by the factory wall
Dirty old [G]town
Dirty old [Am]town

Clouds a drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town {repeat: 2}

Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring of the smoky wind
Dirty old town {repeat: 2}

I'm going to make a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town {repeat: 2}
