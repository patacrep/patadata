It was Christmas [C]Eve babe
In the [F]drunk tank
An old man [C]said to me
Won't see an[G]other one
{newline}
And then he [C]sang a song
The Rare Old [F]Mountain Dew
And I turned my [C]face away
And [F]dreamed a[G]bout [C]you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
{newline}
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got [C]cars
Big as [G]bars
They've got [Am]rivers of [F]gold
But the [C]wind goes right through you
It's no place for the [G]old
{newline}
When you [C]first took my [Am]hand
On a [C]cold Christmas [F]Eve
You [C]promised me
Broadway was [G]waiting for [C]me

[C]You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York [G]City
When the [C]band finished [F]playing
They [G]howled out for [C]more
{newline}
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on the corner
Then danced through the night

{start_of_chorus}
  The [F]boys of the NY[Am]PD [G]choir
  Were [C]singing ``Galway [Am]Bay''
  And the [C]bells were [F]ringing
  [G]Out for Christmas [C]day
{end_of_chorus}

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Living there almost dead
On a drip in that bed
{newline}
You scum bag
You maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

I could have been someone
So could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
{newline}
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you
