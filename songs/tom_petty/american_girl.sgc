    [D] Well she was an A[E7]merican girl
    [G] Raised on [A]promises
    [D] She couldn't help [E7]thinking that there was
    A [G]little more to life [A]somewhere else
  

  \begin{verse*}
    After all it was a [D]great big world
    [G] With lots of places to [Em]run to
    [A]And if she had to die tryin' she had one little promise she was gonna keep
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [G] Oh yeah, [A] allright
    [D] Take it easy baby
    [Bm] Make it last all night
    [G] She was [A] an American [D]girl

      [D] Well it was kinda [E7]cold that night
      [G]She stood alone on the [A]balcony
      [D] Yeah, she could hear the [E7]cars roll by
      Out on [G]four forty one like [A]waves crashing on the beach
    

    \begin{verse*}
      And for one desperate [D]moment there
      [G]He crept back in her [Em]memory
      [A]God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far to reach
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
