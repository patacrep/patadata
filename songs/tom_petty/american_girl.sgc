[D] Well she was an A[E7]merican girl
[G] Raised on [A]promises
[D] She couldn't help [E7]thinking that there was
A [G]little more to life [A]somewhere else
{newline}
After all it was a [D]great big world
[G] With lots of places to [Em]run to
[A]And if she had to die tryin' she had one little promise she was gonna keep

{start_of_chorus}
  [G] Oh yeah, [A] allright
  [D] Take it easy baby
  [Bm] Make it last all night
  [G] She was [A] an American [D]girl
{end_of_chorus}

[D] Well it was kinda [E7]cold that night
[G]She stood alone on the [A]balcony
[D] Yeah, she could hear the [E7]cars roll by
Out on [G]four forty one like [A]waves crashing on the beach
{newline}
And for one desperate [D]moment there
[G]He crept back in her [Em]memory
[A]God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far to reach
