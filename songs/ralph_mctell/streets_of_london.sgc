    [C]Have you seen the [G]old man, [Am]in the closed-down [Em]market
    [F]picking up the [C]papers, with his [D7]worn-out [G7]shoes?
    [C]In his eyes you [G]see no pride, [Am]and held loosely [Em]by his side
    [F]yesterday's [C]papers, telling [G7]yesterday's [C]news
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C] So [F]how can you [Em]tell me, you're [C]lo - ne - [Am]ly
    [D7] and say for [D7]you that the sun don't [G]shine? [G7]
    [C]Let me take you [G]by the hand, and [Am]lead you through the [Em]streets of London
    [F] I'll show you [C]something, to [G7]make you change your [C]mind

      [C]Have you seen the [G]old gal, [Am]who walks the streets of [Em]London
      [Em]dirt in her [C]hair, and her [D7]clothes in [G7]rags?
      [C]She's no time for [G]talking, she [Am]just keeps right on [Em]walking
      [F]Carrying her [C]home, in [G7]two carrier [C]bags
    

    
      [C]In the all-night [G]cafe, at a [Am]quarter past el[Em]even
      [Em]same old [C]man sitting [D7]there, on his [G7]own
      [C]Looking at the [G]world, over the [Am]rim of his [Em]tea-cup
      [F]Each day lasts an [C]hour, then he [G7]wanders home a[C]lone
    

    
      [C]Have you seen the [G]old man, [Am]outside the seaman's [Em]mission?
      [Em]His memory's [C]fading, with those [D7]medal ribbons that he [G7]wears
      [C]And in our winter [G]city, the rain [Am]cries little [Em]pity
      [F]For one more forgotten [C]hero, and a [G7]world that doesn't [C]care
