  \begin{verse}
    \[Am]No milk today, my \[C]love has gone away
    The \[E7]bottle stands for \[Am]lorn, a \[E7]symbol of the \[Am]dawn
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    No milk today, it seems a common sight
    But people passing by don't know the reason why
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[A]How could they know just \[G]what this message means
    The \[D]end of my hopes, the \[D]end of \[E7]all my \[A]dreams
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    How could they know the palace there had been
    Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    No milk today, it wasn't always so
    The company was gay, we turned night into day
  \end{verse}

  \begin{bridge}
    \[A]But all that's \[E]left is a \[D]place dark and \[E]lonely
    \[A]A terraced \[E]house in a \[D]mean street back of \[F#m]town
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{bridge}
    \[A]Becomes a \[E]shrine when I \[D]think of you \[E]only
    \[D]Just two up two \[E]down
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{verse}
    No milk today, it wasn't always so
    The company was gay, we turned night into day
  \end{verse}

  \begin{bridge}
    As music played the faster did we dance
    We felt it both at once, the start of our romance
  \end{bridge}
