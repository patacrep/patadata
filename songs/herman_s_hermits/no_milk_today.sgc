    [Am]No milk today, my [C]love has gone away
    The [E7]bottle stands for [Am]lorn, a [E7]symbol of the [Am]dawn
  

  
    No milk today, it seems a common sight
    But people passing by don't know the reason why
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [A]How could they know just [G]what this message means
    The [D]end of my hopes, the [D]end of [E7]all my [A]dreams
  {end_of_chorus}

  {start_of_chorus}
    How could they know the palace there had been
    Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    No milk today, it wasn't always so
    The company was gay, we turned night into day
  

  \begin{bridge}
    [A]But all that's [E]left is a [D]place dark and [E]lonely
    [A]A terraced [E]house in a [D]mean street back of [F#m]town
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{bridge}
    [A]Becomes a [E]shrine when I [D]think of you [E]only
    [D]Just two up two [E]down
  \end{bridge}

  
    No milk today, it wasn't always so
    The company was gay, we turned night into day
  

  \begin{bridge}
    As music played the faster did we dance
    We felt it both at once, the start of our romance
  \end{bridge}
