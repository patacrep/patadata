[Am]No milk today, my [C]love has gone away
The [E7]bottle stands for [Am]lorn, a [E7]symbol of the [Am]dawn

No milk today, it seems a common sight
But people passing by don't know the reason why

{start_of_chorus}
  [A]How could they know just [G]what this message means
  The [D]end of my hopes, the [D]end of [E7]all my [A]dreams
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  How could they know the palace there had been
  Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
{end_of_chorus}

No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we turned night into day

{start_of_bridge}
[A]But all that's [E]left is a [D]place dark and [E]lonely
[A]A terraced [E]house in a [D]mean street back of [F#m]town
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_bridge}
[A]Becomes a [E]shrine when I [D]think of you [E]only
[D]Just two up two [E]down
{end_of_bridge}

No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we turned night into day

{start_of_bridge}
As music played the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance
{end_of_bridge}
