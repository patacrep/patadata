    [C]There's a calm sur[G]render
    [C]To the rush of [G]day
    [C]When the heat of the [G]rolling world
    [Am]Can be turned a[D]way
    [C]An enchanted [G]moment
    [C]And it sees me [G]through
    [C]It's enough for this [Em]restless warrior
    [F]Just to be with [D]you
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    And [G]can you [D]feel the [Em]love to[C]night?
    [G] It is [C]where we [D]are
    [C] It's e[G]nough for this [Em]wide-[G]eyed [C]wanderer
    [Am]That [G]we [C]got this [D]far
  {end_of_chorus}

  {start_of_chorus}
    And can you feel the love tonight?
    How it's laid to rest?
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Be[Am]lieve [G]the [C]very [G]best
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    There's a time for everyone
    If they only learn
    That the twisting kaleidoscope
    Moves us all in turn
    There's a rhyme and reason
    To the wild outdoors
    When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
    Beats in time with yours
