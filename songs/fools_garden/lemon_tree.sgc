I'm [Em]sitting here in the [Bm]boring room
It's [Em]just another rainy Sunday [Bm]afternoon
I'm [Em]wasting my time, I got [Bm]nothing to do
I'm [Em]hanging around, I'm [Bm]waiting for you
But [Am]nothing ever happens [Bm] and I [Em]wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

{start_of_chorus}
  I [G]wonder how, I [D]wonder why
  [Em]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Bm]blue blue sky
  And [C]all that I can [D]see
  Is just a yellow [G]lemon-tree [D]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  I'm turning my head up and down
  I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
  And all that I can see
  Is just another lemon-tree
{end_of_chorus}

I'm sitting here, I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder

[B]Isolation [Em]is not good for me
[D]Isolation [G]I don't want to
Sit on the [B]lemon-tree
{newline}
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder
