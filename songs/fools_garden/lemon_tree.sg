  \begin{verse}
    I'm \[Em]sitting here in the \[Bm]boring room
    It's \[Em]just another rainy Sunday \[Bm]afternoon
    I'm \[Em]wasting my time, I got \[Bm]nothing to do
    I'm \[Em]hanging around, I'm \[Bm]waiting for you
    But \[Am]nothing ever happens \[Bm] and I \[Em]wonder
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    I'm driving around in my car
    I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
    I'd like to change my point of view
    I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    But nothing ever happens and I wonder
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    I \[G]wonder how, I \[D]wonder why
    \[Em]Yesterday you told me 'bout the \[Bm]blue blue sky
    And \[C]all that I can \[D]see
    Is just a yellow \[G]lemon-tree \[D]
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    I'm turning my head up and down
    I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    And all that I can see
    Is just another lemon-tree
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    I'm sitting here, I miss the power
    I'd like to go out taking a shower
    But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
    I feel so tired, put myself into bed
    Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    \[B]Isolation \[Em]is not good for me
    \[D]Isolation \[G]I don't want to
    Sit on the \[B]lemon-tree
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
    Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
    And everything will happen and you wonder
  \end{verse*}
