{guitar_comment: Intro:  [D G A G]}
{newline}
[D]Where is the [G]moment when we need it the [A]most [G]
[D]You kick up the [G]leaves and the magic is [A]lost [G]
[Bm]They tell me your [A]blue sky's faded to [G]grey
They tell me your [D]passion's gone a[Em]way
And I don't need no carrying [A]on [G] [A]

[D]Stand in the [G]line just ahead of the [A]law [G]
[D]You're faking a [G]smile with the coffee you [A]go [G]
[Bm]You tell me your [A]life's been way off [G]line
You're falling to [D]pieces every[Em]time
And I don't need no carrying [A]on

{start_of_chorus}
  'Cause you had a bad [D]day
  You're taking one [G]down
  You sing a sad [Em]song just to turn it a[A]round
  You say you don't [D]know
  You tell me don't [G]lie
  You work at a [Em]smile and you go for a [A]ride
  You had a bad [Bm]day
  The camera don't [A]lie
  You're coming back [G]down and you really don't [D]mind
  You had a bad [Em]day [A]
  You had a bad [D]day
{end_of_chorus}

{guitar_comment:  [D G A G] {repeat: 2}}

{start_of_bridge}
Well you need a [A]blue sky holi[G]day
The point is they [D]laugh at what you [Em]say
And I don't need no carrying [A]on
{end_of_bridge}

{guitar_comment: Chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[F]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the [Bb]whole thing it turns out wrong
You [F]might not make it back and you know
That you could [Bb]be well oh that strong
Well I'm not [A]wrong
Yeah...
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_bridge}
[D]So where is the [G]passion when you need it the [A]most
[G]Oh you and I
[D]You kick up the [G]leaves and the magic is [A]lost
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
  Cause you had a bad [D]day
  You're taking one [G]down
  You sing a sad [Em]song just to turn it a[A]round
  You say you don't [D]know
  You tell me don't [G]lie
  You work at a [Em]smile and you go for a [A]ride
  You had a bad [Bm]day
  It seem what you [Bm]like
  And how does it [Bm7]feel for one more [Bm6]time
  You had a bad [A]day
  You had a bad [D]day
{end_of_chorus}
