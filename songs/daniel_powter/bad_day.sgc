  \end{verse*}

  
    [D]Where is the [G]moment when we need it the [A]most [G]
    [D]You kick up the [G]leaves and the magic is [A]lost [G]
    [Bm]They tell me your [A]blue sky's faded to [G]grey
    They tell me your [D]passion's gone a[Em]way
    And I don't need no carrying [A]on [G] [A]
  

  
    [D]Stand in the [G]line just ahead of the [A]law [G]
    [D]You're faking a [G]smile with the coffee you [A]go [G]
    [Bm]You tell me your [A]life's been way off [G]line
    You're falling to [D]pieces every[Em]time
    And I don't need no carrying [A]on
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    'Cause you had a bad [D]day
    You're taking one [G]down
    You sing a sad [Em]song just to turn it a[A]round
    You say you don't [D]know
    You tell me don't [G]lie
    You work at a [Em]smile and you go for a [A]ride
    You had a bad [Bm]day
    The camera don't [A]lie
    You're coming back [G]down and you really don't [D]mind
    You had a bad [Em]day [A]
    You had a bad [D]day

  \begin{bridge}
    Well you need a [A]blue sky holi[G]day
    The point is they [D]laugh at what you [Em]say
    And I don't need no carrying [A]on
  \end{bridge}

  \musicnote{\Chorus}

  \begin{bridge}
    [F]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
    And the [B&]whole thing it turns out wrong
    You [F]might not make it back and you know
    That you could [B&]be well oh that strong
    Well I'm not [A]wrong
    Yeah{\dots}
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{bridge}
    [D]So where is the [G]passion when you need it the [A]most
    [G]Oh you and I
    [D]You kick up the [G]leaves and the magic is [A]lost
  \end{bridge}

  {start_of_chorus}
    Cause you had a bad [D]day
    You're taking one [G]down
    You sing a sad [Em]song just to turn it a[A]round
    You say you don't [D]know
    You tell me don't [G]lie
    You work at a [Em]smile and you go for a [A]ride
    You had a bad [Bm]day
    It seem what you [Bm]like
    And how does it [Bm7]feel for one more [Bm6]time
    You had a bad [A]day
    You had a bad [D]day
