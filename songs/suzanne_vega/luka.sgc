    [G] My name is [D]Luka
    [C] I live on the [D]second floor
    [G] I live ups[D]tairs from you
    [C] Yes I think you've [D]seen me before
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Em] If you hear [D]something late at night
    [Em] Some kind of [D]trouble, some kind of fight
    [C] Just don't [D]ask me what it was \rep{3}
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    I think it's because I'm clumsy
    I try not to talk too loud
    Maybe it's because I'm crazy
    I try not to act too proud
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    They only hit until you cry
    After that you don't ask why
    You just don't argue anymore \rep{3}
  {end_of_chorus}

    Yes I think I'm okay
    I walked into the door again
    Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
    And it's not your business anyway
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    I guess I'd like to be alone
    With nothing broken, nothing thrown
    Just don't ask me how I am \rep{3}
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    My name is Luka
    I live on the second floor
    I live upstairs from you
    Yes I think you've seen me before
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    If you hear something late at night
    Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
    Just don't ask me what it was \rep{3}
  {end_of_chorus}
