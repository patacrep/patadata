    [G7]Some people [Bm]live for the [Em]fortune
    [Am]Some people live just for the [D]fame
    [G7]Some people [Bm]live for the [Em]power, yeah
    [Am]Some people live just to play the [D]game
    [G7]Some people [Am]think that the [Bm]physical [Am]things
    [G7]Define [Am]what's with[Bm]in [Am]\dots~And I've
    [G7]Been there [Am]before, [Bm]that life's a [Am]bore
    [G7]So full of the [Am]superfi[Bm]cial
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [G7]Some [Am]peo[Bm]ple [C7]want it all, but
    I don't [Bm]want nothing at all
    If it ain't [Am]you baby
    If I ain't got [G7]you baby
    [G7]Some [Am]people [Bm]want [C7]diamond rings
    Some just want [Bm]everything, but everything means
    [Am]Nothing, if I ain't got [G7]you, yeah
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Some people search for a fountain
    That promises forever young
    Some people need three dozen roses. And
    That's the only way to prove you love them
    Hand me the world on a silver platter and
    What good would it be with
    No one to share. No one who truly
    Cares for me

    If I ain't [Am]got you with me baby [G7]
    [G7]So [Am]nothing in [Bm]this [C7]whole wide world don't mean a [Bm]thing
    If I ain't got you with [Am]me baby [G7]
