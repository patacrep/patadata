[F] Got no [C]reason
For [F]coming to me and the [C]rain running [F]down
There's no [C]reason [Am]
{newline}
[F] And the [C]same voice
[F]Coming to me like it's [C]all slowin' [F]down
And be[C]lieve me [G]

{start_of_chorus}
  I was the [Am]one who let you [C]know
  I was your [G]sorry-ever-[F]after
  '[Am]74 -- '[C]75 [G]
{end_of_chorus}

It's not easy
Nothing to say 'cause it's already said
It's never easy
{newline}
When I look oh, in your eyes
Then I find that I'll do fine
When I look oh, in your eyes then I do better

{start_of_chorus}
  I was the one who let you know
  I was your sorry-ever-after
  '74 -- '75
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  Giving me more and I'll defy
  'Cause you're really only after
  '74 -- '75
