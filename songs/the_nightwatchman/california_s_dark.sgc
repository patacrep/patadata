It started in base[F#]ments
[B] And it started in [F#]sheds
It started in back[F#]yards
[B] And was hidden under [F#]beds
{newline}
[E] I turned on the TV
[B] Don't believe a word they [F#]say
[E] We can't stay here now love
[B] And we can't get away [F#]

{start_of_chorus}
  [B] There's a riot on [F#]sunset
  [B] And fires burn in the [F#]park
  [B] The sun has [F#]set my friend
  [B] And California's dark [A F#]
{end_of_chorus}

And over the screaming
I heard a clear voice
I looked at my choices
And I made a choice
{newline}
Smoke and ashes
Tonight hide the stars
The stop lights are red now, love
We've come for what's ours

{guitar_comment: power chords}

Come stand among the rattlesnakes
At the side of the desert road
And close your eyes and listen
To the music hard and cold
{newline}
Tonight the moon is blackened
Tonight the doors are shut
Behind the shuttered windows
We pray the sun will come up

{guitar_comment: standard chords}

For something walks across these fields
For which there is no name
You might have heard different
But I was there when it came
{newline}
It will start with a spark
And a great fire will grow
Don't know how I know it
But I just know

{start_of_chorus}
  There's a riot on sunset
  And fires burn in the park
  The sun sets everywhere
  And the whole damn country's dark
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
  There's a riot on Sunset
  And fires burn in the park
  The sun has set my friend
  And California's dark
{end_of_chorus}
