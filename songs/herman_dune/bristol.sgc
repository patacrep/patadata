On the [Em]bus back from Bristol
We talked about death
And we talked about a friend
That I'd [D]spent some time with [Am]once or twice a [Em]year
{newline}
We got to your house
All cold and out of breath
Your child was asleep
We sat down and you offered us a beer

{start_of_chorus}
  You said, ``[Em]Do you know what happened to[D]day?''
  And I said, ``[Em]No''
{end_of_chorus}

He was family to millions
All over the evening news
But I tend to keep away
From the press, the TV and the radio
{newline}
I like to keep my mind clean
When I can I always choose
To focus on what's here and
Not know what the world wants me to know

{start_of_chorus}
  You said, ``Would you want some tea or another drink?''
  And I said, ``No''
{end_of_chorus}

We'd had sun in Bristol and
Fun with friends in London
And an awesome time as usual
On tops of hills ... in Leeds
{newline}
We listened to Fred Neil
It sounded dark with the loudness on
You whispered to me
People whisper when a baby sleeps

{start_of_chorus}
  You said, ``Will you need an extra blanket?''
  And I said, ``No''
{end_of_chorus}
