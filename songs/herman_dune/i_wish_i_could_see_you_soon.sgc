I [C]had to leave you and go [F]away
But I, [C]think about you [G7]every day
[C]In the morning and in the [F]afternoon
[G]I wish that I could see you [C]soon

And when I held you I felt so fine
It was like there was, nothing left on my mind
It was like Rockaway beach in the month of June
I wish that I could see you soon

I had no plans no meet you baby
I had a million things to do baby
But you hit my heart with a harpoon
I wish that I could see you soon

{start_of_chorus}
  How long 'till you can see her?
  And I'm like, the sooner the better
  Do you, really think she will wait for you?
  Well I have no way to say
  And there is nothing I can do {repeat: 2}
{end_of_chorus}

Now that I am across the sea
I wonder if, you're gonna wait for me
Or if you're gonna find a new boy to spoon
I wish that I could see you soon

And if you, wait a little my pretty friend
Until I, come back to hold your hand
We'll be like bugs when they break through a cocoon
I wish that I could see you soon

It's been a while, since I felt like this
And now I found someone I really miss
Under the sun, under the moon
I wish that I could see you soon
