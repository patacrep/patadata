And see the [F#m]flock of birds, black as your apartment is at night
Take [E]off when my dog comes a-running to bite
And as they [Bm]sit on their branches to watch the game
They're [F#m]chanting your name
The [E]crows at the game
They [F#m]chant your name

And as I drive home listening to Kimya's record on K
There's this deer with its little ones in the field off the freeway
And it's teaching its fawns who are still a bit lame
To chant your name
The baby deer still lame
They know your name

And the birch trees and the pine trees behind the summer house
They raise their voices when the cigarette drops from the city boy's mouth
And when they're shit-scared that a mighty fire could start with a tiny flame
Man, they call out your name
Shit-scared of a tiny flame
Even the trees call your name

And the baboon in the cage at the mercy of scientists
He is brave and he's a-showing his teeth to resist
And despite all the drugs that they are using to tame
Him, he's a-shouting your name
The baboon that no-one can tame
He's a-shouting your name
{newline}
To the scientists who feel no shame
He's a-shouting your name
And when I'm lost again
Well I do the same
I shout your name
