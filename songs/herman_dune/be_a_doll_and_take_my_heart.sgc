    You make a [C]mess of your [G]hair [D Em]
    When you're [C]sad [G D Em]
    I'll try to [C]make you feel [G]better [D Em]
    When you'll feel [C]bad [G D Em]
    I will [C]kiss on the forehead
    For a [D]start

    Be a [C]doll and take my [G]heart [D Em] \rep{4}
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    From the last frontier
    To the Sunshine state
    From Volunteer
    To the Empire state
    We'll run around together
    Never apart
  

  
    May you live
    And not die
    May you never love
    Another guy
    May there always be a fire
    Shooting from our sparks
