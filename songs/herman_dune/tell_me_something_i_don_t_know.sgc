    You are a [C]hero, you are off the hook
    I read you like a [Am]poem or a holy book
    You're the kind of girl who would [F]jump out the window
    [G]Tell me something I don't know
  

  
    You call me at home and at the restaurant
    When you feel alone and whenever you want
    When I got to the movies and when I'm watching the show
    Yo, tell me something I don't know
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [C]Tell me, tell me, tell me
    [Am]Tell me something I don't know
    [F]Tell me, tell me, tell me
    [G]Tell me something, tell me something
    Tell me something I don't know
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    You say why don't you go down to the record store?
    I said every new band sounds like I heard them before
    You say I should have lived a hundred years ago
    And then I go, tell me something I don't know!
  

  
    In the morning, it's six and your clock is beeping
    You kiss me goodbye but baby I'm still sleeping
    You see, I wish that I could stay with you but then I really have to go
    Yo, tell me something I don't know
