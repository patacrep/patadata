You are a [C]hero, you are off the hook
I read you like a [Am]poem or a holy book
You're the kind of girl who would [F]jump out the window
[G]Tell me something I don't know

You call me at home and at the restaurant
When you feel alone and whenever you want
When I got to the movies and when I'm watching the show
Yo, tell me something I don't know

{start_of_chorus}
  [C]Tell me, tell me, tell me
  [Am]Tell me something I don't know
  [F]Tell me, tell me, tell me
  [G]Tell me something, tell me something
  Tell me something I don't know
{end_of_chorus}

You say why don't you go down to the record store?
I said every new band sounds like I heard them before
You say I should have lived a hundred years ago
And then I go, tell me something I don't know!

In the morning, it's six and your clock is beeping
You kiss me goodbye but baby I'm still sleeping
You see, I wish that I could stay with you but then I really have to go
Yo, tell me something I don't know
