    [Em] A howling wind is whistling [Am] in the night
    [B7] My dog is growling in the [Em]dark
    [Em]Something's pulling me [Am] outside
    [B7] To ride around in [Em]circles
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [Em] I know that you have [Am] got the time
    [B7] Cause anything I want, [Em] you do
    [Em] You'll take a ride through the [Am]strangers
    Who [B7]{don't} understand how to [Em]feel
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Em]In the deathcar, we're alive [Am B7]
    [Em]In the deathcar, we're alive [Am B7]
  {end_of_chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    
      [Em] I'll let some air come [Am] in the window
      [B7] It kind of wakes me up [Em] a little
      [Em] I don't turn on the [Am]radio
      [B7] Cause they play shit, like [Em]\dots, you know
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [Em] When your hand was [Am] down on my dick
      [B7] It felt quite a[Em]mazing
      [Em] And now that, that is [Am] all over
      [B7] All we've got is the [Em]silence
    \end{verse*}

    
      [Em] When I touched you [Am] I felt that
      [B7] You still had your [Em]baby fat
      [Em] And a little taste of [Am]baby's breath
      [B7] Makes me for[Em]get about death
    

    \begin{verse*}
      [Em] At your age [Am] you're still joking
      [B7] It ain't time yet [Em] for the choking
      [Em] So now we can [Am] own the movie
      [B7] And know each other [Em] truly
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
