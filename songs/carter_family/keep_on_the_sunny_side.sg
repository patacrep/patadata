  \begin{verse}
    There's a \[B&]dark and a \[E&]troubled side of \[B&]life
    But there's a \[B&]bright and a sunny side \[F]too
    Though you \[F]meet with the darkness and \[B&]strife
    The \[F]sunny side you also may \[B&]view
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[B&]Keep on the sunny side, \[E&]always on the \[B&]sunny side
    \[B&]Keep on the sunny side of \[F]life
    It will \[B&]help us every day, it will \[E&]brighten all the \[B&]way
    If we'll \[B&]keep \[E&]{on the} \[B&]sunny \[F]side of \[B&]life
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Though the storm and its furies rage today
    Crushing hope that we cherish so dear
    The cloud and storm will in time pass away
    And the sun again will shine bright and clear
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Let us greet with a song of hope each day
    Though the moment be cloudy or fair
    And let us trust in our Saviour always
    He'll keep us everyone in His care
  \end{verse}
