In the [C]highways, in the hedges
In the [G]highways, in the [C]hedges
In the [C]highways, in the hedges
I'll be [G]somewhere working for my [C]Lord

  I'll be [F]somewhere working
  I'll be [C]somewhere working
  I'll be [G]somewhere working for my [C]Lord

If He calls me I will answer {repeat: 3}
I'll be somewhere working for my Lord
