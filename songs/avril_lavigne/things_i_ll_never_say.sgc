    [Bm] I'm tugging at my [G]hair, I'm pulling at my [D]clothes
    I'm trying to keep my [Asus2]cool, I know it [Bm]shows
    [Bm] I'm staring at my [G]feet, my cheeks are turning [D]red
    I'm searching for the [Asus2]words inside my [Em]head
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [E] I'm feeling nervous, [G]tryin' to be so perfect
    [E] Cause I know you're worth it, [Asus2]you're worth it, yeah
  \end{verse*}

  {start_of_chorus}
    [D] If I can say what I wanna [A]say, I say I wanna blow [Bm]you away
    Be with you every [G]night, am I squeezing you too [D]tight
    [D] If I can say what I wanna [A]see, I wanna see you go dow[Bm]n on one knee
    Marry me to[G]day, cause I'm wishing my life [Em]away
    [C] Well these things I'll never say
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    They don't do me any good, it's just a waste of time
    What use is it to you what's on my mind
    If it ain't coming out, we're not going anywhere
    So why can't I just tell you that I care
  

  \begin{verse*}
    Cause I'm feeling nervous, tryin' to be so perfect
    Cause I know you're worth it, you're worth it, yeah
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    [Bm] What's wr[A]ong with my [G]tongue, these words keep slipping away
    [Bm] I stut[A]ter I stum[G]ble, like I've got nothing to [Em]say
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Cause I'm feeling nervous, tryin' to be so perfect
    Cause I know you're worth it, you're worth it, yeah
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    [G] Yes I'm wishin' my life a[Em]way
    [C] These things I'll never [D]say
  \end{verse*}
