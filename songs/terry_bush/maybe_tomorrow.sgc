There's a [Dm]voice, that keeps on calling [C]me
Down the [Dm]road, that's where I'll always [C]be
Every [F]stop I make, I make a new [Dm]friend
Can't stay for [Bb]long, just turn a[C]round and I'm gone a[F]gain
Maybe tomo[Dm]rrow, I'll [Bb]want to settle [F]down [Am7] [Dm]
Until tomo[Gm]rrow, I'll [Bb]just keep movin' [F]on

Down this road, that never seems to end
Where new adventure, lies just around the bend
So if you wanna join me for a while
Just grab your hat, come travel light, that's hobo style
Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
Until tomorrow, the whole world is my home

{start_of_chorus}
  So if you [F]wanna join me for a [Dm]while
  Just grab your [Bb]hat, come travel [C]light, that's hobo [F]style
  Maybe tomo[Dm]rrow, I'll [Bb]want to settle [F]down [Am7] [Dm]
  Until tomo[Gm]rrow, I'll [Bb]just keep movin' [F]on

There's a world, that's waiting to unfold
A brand new tale, no one has ever told
We've journey'd far, far, but now it won't be long
We're almost there and we've paid our fare with the hobo song
Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
Until tomorrow, I'll just keep movin' on

{start_of_chorus}
  So if you wanna join me for a while
  Just grab your hat, come travel light, that's hobo style
  Maybe tomorrow, I'll find what I call home
  Until tomorrow, you know I'm free to roam
