    There's a [Dm]voice, that keeps on calling [C]me
    Down the [Dm]road, that's where I'll always [C]be
    Every [F]stop I make, I make a new [Dm]friend
    Can't stay for [B&]long, just turn a[C]round and I'm gone a[F]gain
    Maybe tomo[Dm]rrow, I'll [B&]want to settle [F]down [Am7] [Dm]
    Until tomo[Gm]rrow, I'll [B&]just keep movin' [F]on
  

  
    Down this road, that never seems to end
    Where new adventure, lies just around the bend
    So if you wanna join me for a while
    Just grab your hat, come travel light, that's hobo style
    Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
    Until tomorrow, the whole world is my home

    So if you [F]wanna join me for a [Dm]while

    There's a world, that's waiting to unfold
    A brand new tale, no one has ever told
    We've journey'd far, far, but now it won't be long
    We're almost there and we've paid our fare with the hobo song
    Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
    Until tomorrow, I'll just keep movin' on
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    So if you wanna join me for a while
    Just grab your hat, come travel light, that's hobo style
    Maybe tomorrow, I'll find what I call home
    Until tomorrow, you know I'm free to roam
