  \end{verse*}

  
    [F]Look for me another [C]day
    I feel that I could [G]change
    I feel that I could [Dm]change
    [F]There's a sudden joy that's [C]like
    A fish, a moving [G]light
    I thought I saw [Dm]it
    [F]Rowing on the lakes of [C]Canada [G]
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    Oh laughing [Dm]man
    What have you [C]won?
    Don't tell me [Am]what cannot be [F]done
    My little [Dm]mouth, my winter [C]lungs
    Don't tell me [Am]what cannot be [F]done
    Cannot be done
    \nolyrics{[F C G Dm]}
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Walking in the circle of
    A flashlight someone starts
    To sing, to join in
    Talk of loneliness in quiet
    Voices I am shy
    But you can reach me
    Rowing on the lakes of Canada \rep{2}
  

  
    So [Dm]look for me another [C]time
    Give me another [Am]day
    I feel that I could [F]change \rep{2}
    [F]Rowing on the lakes of [C]Canada [G] \rep{8}
