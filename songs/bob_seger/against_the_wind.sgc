    [G] It seems like yesterday
    [Bm] But it was long ago
    [C] Janey was lovely, she was the [G]queen of my nights
    [D]There in the darkness with the ra[C]dio, playing low
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [G] And the secrets that we shared
    [Bm] The mountains that we moved
    [C] Caught like wildfire [G]out of control
    Till there was [C]nothing left to burn and nothing left to [D]prove
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    And I re[Em]member [D]what she said to [G]me
    How she [Em]swore that it [C]never would [G]end
    I re[Em]member how she held [D]me, oh [C]so tight
    [C]Wish I didn't know now what I [D]{didn't} know then
  \end{verse*}


  {start_of_chorus}
    [G] Against the wind [Bm]
    [C] We were running against the [G]wind
    We were [C]young and [Bm]strong
    We were [Am]running a[C]gainst the [G]wind
  {end_of_chorus}


  
    [G] And the years rolled slowly past
    [Bm] And I found myself alone
    [C] Surrounded by strangers I [G]thought were my friends
    I [D]found myself further and [C]further from my home
  

  \begin{verse*}
    [G] And I guess I lost my way
    [Bm] There were oh, so many roads
    I was [C]living to run, and [G]running to live
    Never wor[D]rying about paying, or even how [C]much I owed
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Runnin' [Em]8 miles a [D]minute for months at a [G]time
    Breaking [Em]all of the [C]rules that would [G]bend
    [Em] I begin to [D]find myself just [C]searching
    [C]Searching for shelter a[D]gain and again
  \end{verse*}


  {start_of_chorus}
    [G] Against the wind [Bm]
    [C] A little something against the [G]wind
    I [C]found my[Bm]self
    Seeking [Am]shelter a[C]gainst the [G]wind
  {end_of_chorus}

    Well those [Em]drifter's [D]days are past [G]me now
    I've got [Em]so much [C]more to think a[G]bout
    [Em] Dead[D]lines and commit[C]ments
    [C] What to leave in? [D] What to leave out?
  


  {start_of_chorus}
    [G] Against the wind [Bm]
    [C] I'm still running against the [G]wind
    I'm [C]older [Bm]now
    but still [Am]running a[C]gainst the [G]wind
  {end_of_chorus}
