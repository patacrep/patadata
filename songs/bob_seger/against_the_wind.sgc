[G] It seems like yesterday
[Bm] But it was long ago
[C] Janey was lovely, she was the [G]queen of my nights
[D]There in the darkness with the ra[C]dio, playing low
{newline}
[G] And the secrets that we shared
[Bm] The mountains that we moved
[C] Caught like wildfire [G]out of control
Till there was [C]nothing left to burn and nothing left to [D]prove
{newline}
And I re[Em]member [D]what she said to [G]me
How she [Em]swore that it [C]never would [G]end
I re[Em]member how she held [D]me, oh [C]so tight
[C]Wish I didn't know now what I [D]didn't know then

{start_of_chorus}
  [G] Against the wind [Bm]
  [C] We were running against the [G]wind
  We were [C]young and [Bm]strong
  We were [Am]running a[C]gainst the [G]wind
{end_of_chorus}

[G] And the years rolled slowly past
[Bm] And I found myself alone
[C] Surrounded by strangers I [G]thought were my friends
I [D]found myself further and [C]further from my home
{newline}
[G] And I guess I lost my way
[Bm] There were oh, so many roads
I was [C]living to run, and [G]running to live
Never wor[D]rying about paying, or even how [C]much I owed
{newline}
Runnin' [Em]8 miles a [D]minute for months at a [G]time
Breaking [Em]all of the [C]rules that would [G]bend
[Em] I begin to [D]find myself just [C]searching
[C]Searching for shelter a[D]gain and again

{start_of_chorus}
  [G] Against the wind [Bm]
  [C] A little something against the [G]wind
  I [C]found my[Bm]self
  Seeking [Am]shelter a[C]gainst the [G]wind
{end_of_chorus}

{comment: First and second stanzas instrumental}

Well those [Em]drifter's [D]days are past [G]me now
I've got [Em]so much [C]more to think a[G]bout
[Em] Dead[D]lines and commit[C]ments
[C] What to leave in? [D] What to leave out?

{start_of_chorus}
  [G] Against the wind [Bm]
  [C] I'm still running against the [G]wind
  I'm [C]older [Bm]now
  but still [Am]running a[C]gainst the [G]wind
{end_of_chorus}
