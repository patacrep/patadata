    [Em]I'm tired of being what you [C]want me to be
    [G]Feeling so faithless lost [D]under the surface
    [Em]I don't know what you're expe[C]cting of me
    Put [G]under the pressure of [D]walking in your sh[C]oes [D]
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
    Every s[Em]tep I take is a[G]nother mistake to [C]you [D]
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
  

  {start_of_chorus}
    [Em]I've become so nu[C]mb I can't feel you t[G]here
    I've become so ti[D]red so much more [Em]aware
    I've becoming [C]this all I want to [G]do
    Is be more like [D]me and be less like [Em]you
  {end_of_chorus}

  
    Can't you see that you're smothering me
    Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
    Cause everything that you thought I would be
    Has fallen apart right in front of you
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
    Every step that I take is another mistake to you
    \echo{Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
    And every second I waste is more than I can take
  

  \begin{verse*}
    And I [D]know
    I may [Em]end [G]up [Em]fail[D]ing [C]too
    But I [D]know
    You were j[B]ust like me with someone disappointed in you
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    I've become so numb I can't feel you there
    Is everything what you want me to be
    I've become so numb I can't feel you there
    Is everything what you want me to be
  \end{verse*}
