[Em]I'm tired of being what you [C]want me to be
[G]Feeling so faithless lost [D]under the surface
[Em]I don't know what you're expe[C]cting of me
Put [G]under the pressure of [D]walking in your sh[C]oes [D]
{echo: Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
Every s[Em]tep I take is a[G]nother mistake to [C]you [D]
{echo: Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}

{start_of_chorus}
  [Em]I've become so nu[C]mb I can't feel you t[G]here
  I've become so ti[D]red so much more [Em]aware
  I've becoming [C]this all I want to [G]do
  Is be more like [D]me and be less like [Em]you
{end_of_chorus}

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
{echo: Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
{echo: Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone}
And every second I waste is more than I can take
{newline}
And I [D]know
I may [Em]end [G]up [Em]fail[D]ing [C]too
But I [D]know
You were j[B]ust like me with someone disappointed in you
{newline}
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Is everything what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Is everything what you want me to be
